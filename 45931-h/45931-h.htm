<span class="small">THE FIRST TEN DAYS.</span></h2>


<p>Already on the shore side the skyline showed
oddly-shaped shadows growing grey in the first
movement of dawn. From the quay a single
lamp threw its scarce light on the careful evolutions
of the ship, and from the darkness beyond
a voice roared in the still night instructing the
pilot with inappropriate oaths and words not
known to respectable dictionaries. There is not
much room to spare for a troop-ship to turn in
the narrow harbour, and by the time we got
alongside the night was past.</p>

<p>The few pedestrians abroad in the streets of
Boulogne at this early hour stood watching what
<a class="pagenum" name="page_002" title="2"> </a>
must to them have seemed a strange procession.
As the pipes were heard all down the steep, narrow
street, there was a head at every window, and
much waving of flags and cheering&mdash;"Vive
l'Angleterre!"</p>

<p>The way through the town is long and steep.
The sun made its heat felt as we neared the top
of the hill and passed long lines of market carts
waiting for examination outside the Bureau de
l'Octroi. Half a mile farther on, beyond the last
few straggling houses, there is a signpost pointing
to the Camp St&nbsp;Martin. Here, in a large field, to
the left of the road, stood four lines of tents of the
familiar pattern. The ground was fresh and clean,
for we were first in the field. From the Camp
St&nbsp;Martin a beautiful view is obtained over the
sea, whence the breeze is always refreshing even
on the hottest morning of the summer.</p>

<p>The country round Boulogne is steeply undulating
pasture-land, hedged and timbered like a typical
English countryside. From the Camp St&nbsp;Martin
the lighthouse of Etaples can be seen, a white
splash where the coast-line disappears over the
horizon; and on such a day as this, when the
haze of the sun's heat makes all distant objects
indistinct, even the most powerful lens will not
show more of the English coast than just a shadow
that mixes with the blur of sea and sky.</p>

<p>The streets of Boulogne were busy all that day
<a class="pagenum" name="page_003" title="3"> </a>
with marching troops. At the quayside, transports
arrived from hour to hour and unloaded their
unusual cargo. From a point on the shore where
Lyon and I were bathing close to the harbour
entrance, we could see far out to sea a large ship,
escorted by a destroyer. As the ship came nearer,
her three decks appeared black with innumerable
dots as if covered by an enormous swarm of bees,
and when she passed the narrow entrance of the
harbour we could see the khaki uniform and hear
the sound of cheering. Cheering crowds lined
the passage of our troops, but it seemed to me
that the people showed little agitation or excitement,
and that anxiety was the prevailing sentiment.</p>

<p>News from the front there was none. No one
knew where the front was. The "Evening Paper,"
a single sheet, printed in large characters on one
side only, confined itself to recording that Liége
still held out, and that General French had gone
to Paris.</p>

<p>The battalion paraded at 10&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span> next morning
at the Camp St&nbsp;Martin for inspection by a French
General. In all armies the ritual of inspection is
much the same, but on this occasion the ceremony
had a special interest from the fact that never
before in history had a British regiment been
inspected by a French General on the soil of
France. The General was accompanied by two
<a class="pagenum" name="page_004" title="4"> </a>
French Staff Officers, one of whom was acting as
interpreter, and from the scrap of talk which
reached my ear as they went past, it seemed that
conversation was proceeding with difficulty. "En
hiver ça doit être terriblement froid," remarked
the General. "Demandez leur donc"&mdash;this to the
interpreter&mdash;"si les hommes portent des culottes
en hiver"!</p>

<p>Leaving St&nbsp;Martin's Camp late on Sunday
evening, entraining in the dark at Boulogne, the
long day in the heavy, slow-moving train before
we reached our detraining station at Aulnois, were
experiences which then held all the interest and
excitement of novelty. From Aulnois to the village
of Taisnières-en-Terache is a pleasant walk of an
hour through a country of high hedges enclosing
orchards and heavy pasture-land. The sunlight
was already fading as we left the station, and
when at last our journey's end was reached it
was pitch dark.</p>

<p>M.&nbsp;le Maire had plenty of straw, the accommodation
was sufficient, and billeting arrangements
were soon completed.</p>

</div>

<p>Our host, a fine-looking old man, tall and
broad with large limbs, abnormally large hands,
and something of a Scotch shrewdness in the
look of his eye, had served in 1870 in a
regiment of Cuirassiers, and showed us the Commemoration
medal which had been granted recently
<a class="pagenum" name="page_005" title="5"> </a>
by the French Government to survivors of the
campaign. We sat down in his parlour about
nine o'clock to a very welcome meal, and at the
conclusion various toasts were drunk in the very
excellent wine of which our host had provided a
bottle apiece for us.</p>

<p>A sentry stood on the road outside the farmyard
gate, where, fortunately, there was not much chance
of his getting anything to do. His orders were to
challenge any party that might come along the
road, and not to let them proceed unless they could
show the necessary pass. These passes were
issued at the Mairie to all the inhabitants of the
commune, and no one was allowed out after dark
except for a definite purpose and at a stated hour
which was to be marked on the pass. So it was
fortunate that no one did pass along that night,
as a nocturnal interview between our bewildered
sentry and a belated French pedestrian would
undoubtedly have aroused the whole company, and
I might have been hauled out of bed in the early
hours of morning to act as interpreter.</p>

<p>The next day, the 17th, Trotter and I were
ordered to go off to St&nbsp;Hilaire, about ten miles
distant, to arrange billets for the battalion. We
started off on horseback in the cool of the morning,
glad of the chance to see something of the country
and to escape the daily dusty route-march.</p>

<p>St&nbsp;Hilaire is a picturesque village situated on the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_006" title="6"> </a>
side of a hill overlooking a large tract of country,
with a fine view of Avesnes, the <i>chef lieu d'arrondissement</i>.
In the absence of the Maire the selection
of billets was rendered very difficult, as many
of the principal houses in the village were locked
up, and no one could tell us if they would be
available. After much perspiring and chattering
in the hot sun, the distribution of accommodation
for men and horses and the chalking up of numbers
at every house was finally accomplished, in spite
of the fact that at each house-door stood a generous
citizen who insisted on our drinking mutual healths
in cider, beer, and curious liqueurs.</p>

<p>By the time we reached Taisnières it was getting
dark, and we were held up on the outskirts of the
village by a sentry belonging to the Royal Scots,
who would not let us in without the password.
Neither of us had the least idea what it was, and
the situation was saved by the appearance of a
N.C.O., who at once let us through.</p>

<p>On reporting at headquarters we found that
orders had been changed, and our destination was
to be not St&nbsp;Hilaire after all, but a village farther
north called St&nbsp;Aubin. And so the day's work
was wasted.</p>

<p>At St&nbsp;Aubin there was no difficulty about billets.
The Maire had everything made ready, so that
when the battalion arrived, tired and hungry after
an early start and a dusty ten-mile walk, it was not
<a class="pagenum" name="page_007" title="7"> </a>
long before dinners were cooking in the farmyards,
and much scrubbing and cleaning of equipment
was in progress all down the village street.</p>

<p>The money for paying out the troops had been
sent in 20-franc notes, presumably through some
error on the part of the paymaster, so that the
notes had to be taken to the nearest bank and
exchanged for the newly issued 5-franc notes.
The adjutant asked me to get a conveyance of
some kind in the village, and to proceed to Avesnes,
where the Sous-préfet, who had been warned of my
arrival, would give all facilities for changing the
money. A large bag of English silver which had
been collected from the men was also to be taken
that it might be exchanged for French money. A
fat innkeeper offered to drive me into Avesnes, and
after many delays and much conversation our
"equipage" was ready. Captain Picton-Warlow,
who had appointed himself escort to the expedition,
looked with some dismay at the dilapidated conveyance.
The horse was of the heavy-jointed, heavy-bellied
variety that seems always to go more slowly
than any living thing. The cart is hard to describe,
although of a kind not easy to forget once one had
been in it for a drive. The body, shaped like a half-circle
balanced on springs, was supposed to hold
three people. The equilibrium, we found, was
maintained by the passengers accommodating their
position to the slope of the road. The driver
<a class="pagenum" name="page_008" title="8"> </a>
addressed the horse as "Cocotte," and we were off,
creating much amusement through the village&mdash;Picton-Warlow,
big and tall, perched up alongside
the driver, trying with some appearance of
dignity to maintain his balance and that of the
cart.</p>

<p>Seven kilometres is more than four miles and less
than five, and although that is the distance from
St&nbsp;Aubin to Avesnes, we managed to spend over
an hour on the road. Cocotte, being weak in
the forelegs, was not allowed to trot downhill, and
could not be expected to do more than crawl
uphill with "trois grands gaillards comme nous
sommes," said our conductor. On level ground
we advanced ("elle fait du chemin quand même
cette pauvre bête") at a cumbersome trot. An
endeavour to get more speed out of the driver by
explaining that we had to be in Avesnes in time to
change some money before the banks closed met
with no success. "The banks at Avesnes have
been closed for three days," said he; but if the
Messieurs wanted change, what need to go so far
as Avesnes when he himself was able and willing
to provide "la monnaie" for a hundred, two hundred,
even a thousand francs. However, we required
far more than our good friend could supply,
and besides, there was the expectant Sous-préfet,
who should not be disappointed, so on we jogged.
Avesnes came in sight long before we got there, as
<a class="pagenum" name="page_009" title="9"> </a>
the town lies in a valley. Our horse and driver,
equally frightened at the steepness of the hill, proceeded
with exasperating caution. Half-way down
the hill tramcars and slippery pavements reduced
our rate of progress still further, until the jogging
of the strangely balanced cart turned into a soothing
rhythmic sweep from side to side.</p>

<p>"Halte! Qui vive!" Our challenger, <i>un brave
père de famille de l'armée territoriale</i>, would not let us
pass without a long gossip, his interest being chiefly
centred in "le kilt." The horse having been
wakened up, we proceeded at a decorous pace
through the town and stopped outside the Café de
la Paix. On the way through the streets we had
attracted a certain amount of attention, and as we
neared the café the nucleus of a fair-sized procession
began to accumulate. After our descent from
the cart the procession became a rapidly swelling
crowd. Telling our driver to remain at the café
to wait orders, I asked where the Sous-préfet could
be found. Monsieur le Sous-préfet was not at his
bureau, "mais à la Sous-préfecture en haut de la
ville; nous allons vous y conduire tout de suite."
And up the street we all went, Picton-Warlow
most embarrassed and suggesting schemes for the
dispersal of the crowd.</p>

<p>The Sous-préfecture, on top of the hill, is a large
comfortable-looking villa, surrounded by quite a
large garden, palm-trees, and flower-beds, with an
<a class="pagenum" name="page_010" title="10"> </a>
imposing stone entrance-gate. Opposite the gateway
is an open square, behind us were the curious
crowds of Avesnois. In front, to our astonishment,
the road was blocked, and two sides of
the square filled up by a whole brigade of
the British troops. A hurried consultation with
Picton-Warlow as to our next move allowed time
for the crowd behind to form up on the remaining
side of the square in the evident expectation
of some interesting military ceremonial. The
entrance to the Sous-préfet's house was guarded by
an officier de gendarmerie on a black horse. We
advanced towards this official, and after mutual
salutes requested to see the Sous-préfet. "M.&nbsp;le
Sous-préfet was receiving the generals, but would
be quite ready to receive us too." As there was
no other way of escaping from the crowd except
through the gateway, we marched off up to the
house, determined to explain the situation to the
servant who opened the door, and ask leave to wait
until the Sous-préfet should be disengaged. The
door was opened by a servant <i>en habit noir</i>, behind
him on a table in the hall we could see caps with
red tabs and gold lace. "It is about time we were
out of this," said Picton-Warlow. The domestic in
evening clothes, doubtless thinking we were some
kind of generals, said in answer to our request to be
allowed to wait that we would be shown in at once.
It was useless to explain that this was precisely what
<a class="pagenum" name="page_011" title="11"> </a>
we wanted to avoid, and as I could get nothing out of
the stupid man but "ces messieurs sont là qui vous
attendent," we determined to beat a retreat. However,
the obtuse domestic was equally determined
that we should not escape. On the right side of
the hall in which we stood were two large folding
doors. Suddenly, and after the manner of Eastern
fairy tales, these huge panelled doors were flung
open. The servant had disappeared and we two
stood alone, unannounced, on the threshold of a large
drawing-room where "ces messieurs" were sitting
in conclave. For an instant we stood speechless
and motionless, taking in at a glance Madame la
Sous-préfete in evening dress seated at the far end
of the room, on her right General M., on the other
side a brigade-major, two French officers of high
rank, and a whole lot of Frenchmen in evening
dress with decorations and ribbons, all seated on
chairs in a circle, a very small fragile Louis&nbsp;XV.
table in the middle. The sudden appearance in
the doorway of a kilted subaltern with two money
bags slung over his shoulder did not seem to
astonish the assembled company, with the exception
of General M.&nbsp;and his brigade-major. I looked
round for some one to apologise to for our intrusion,
and was about to make a polite speech to the lady
in evening dress, when a gentleman dressed in black
silk, slim and courteous, advanced into the middle
of the room. It was M.&nbsp;le Sous-préfet. In the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_012" title="12"> </a>
name of France, in the name of the Republic and
of the Town Council and citizens of Avesnes, he
welcomed us. He went on at some length, dignified
as only a Frenchman can be, and most flattering.
I began to feel like an ambassador. When
the address was completed, I replied to the best of
my ability in the same strain, expressing our
devotion, &amp;c., to France, the Republic, Avesnes,
and our consciousness of the great honour that
was being done to us, ending up with an apology
for intrusion upon their deliberations, and proposing
to retire to the place whence we had come.</p>

<p>But the Sous-préfet would not hear of our leaving;
"Quand Messieurs les Ecossais viennent à Avesnes
il faut boire le champagne." With these words he
led me forward, Picton-Warlow following reluctantly
in the rear, and introduced us to M<span class="Mme">me.</span> la Sous-préfete.
Picton-Warlow, after shaking hands with
the gracious lady, took refuge on a chair next the
brigade-major, while I was taken to the other end
of the circle and introduced to M.&nbsp;le Maire. The
money-bags had escaped notice, and I was glad to
get rid of them by placing them under my chair.
The circle broken by our unexpected arrival now
re-formed, and as we sat waiting for the champagne,
I was informed by my neighbour the Maire
that the gentlemen in evening dress were members
of the Conseil Municipal of Avesnes who had been
summoned by the Sous-préfet to do honour to
<a class="pagenum" name="page_013" title="13"> </a>
General M., whose brigade was to billet in or near
the town. Not many minutes passed before the
champagne arrived, ready poured out, the glasses
carried in on a large tray by the daughter of the
house, a self-possessed young lady of perhaps fourteen
years of age. Close behind followed a younger
brother in bare legs, short socks, and black knickerbocker
suit, carrying a dish of cakes and biscuits.
With a glass of champagne in each hand, our host
crossed over to General M.&nbsp;and pledged a lengthy
toast in somewhat similar style to the speech which
had been made to me. "I drink," said he, "to the
most noble and the most brave, as well as the most
celebrated of British Generals." During the delivery
of the address General M.&nbsp;looked most
uncomfortable, especially when his qualifications
and qualities were being enumerated; in reply,
he made a very gracious bow to the Sous-préfet,
and we sipped healths all round. After the champagne
had been drunk the party became more
animated, and formed into groups, in each of which
was a distinguished guest struggling with unreasonable
French genders, and I was presently able to
explain quietly to our host the motive of our visit.
M.&nbsp;le Sous-préfet had never had any word of such
an errand; he said that the banks would be shut for
another week, but suggested that the Receveur des
Impôts would be able to provide such change as
might be required. Meantime Picton-Warlow had
<a class="pagenum" name="page_014" title="14"> </a>
been talking to the Brigadier, who had by now realised
and was most amused at the situation. When
we got up to bid our adieux, I heard the General
say&mdash;<i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;to Picton-Warlow, "For God's
sake don't go off and leave us here alone." When
I turned round at the door and saluted the assembly
there was a distinct twinkle in M.'s eye, and I think
the Sous-préfet was not without some slight quiver
of the eyelid as he bade us a cordial farewell.</p>

<p>The "Bureau du Receveur" was open, but there
was no one about save the caretaker, who informed
us that the "patron" had gone off with all his
clerks "to see the English march round the town."
We directed our steps towards the swelling sound
of pipe-and-drum band, and mingled with the
crowd lining the main boulevard which encircles
the upper part of the town. P.&nbsp;W. made friends
with a French soldier who was in charge of a motor-car
which was held up within the barrier formed by
the circular man&oelig;uvre of the Brigade. It appeared
from what this man said that the citizens of Avesnes
had made great preparations to welcome the men,
and that they were so disappointed on hearing that
the troops were under orders to march farther north
that General M., at the Sous-préfet's request, promised
to march his men three times round the
town. The whole population had turned out to
witness the parade, and there did not seem to be
much chance of retrieving the Receveur des Impôts
<a class="pagenum" name="page_015" title="15"> </a>
from among the enthusiastic cheering mob that
swelled around. Our new-found friend, the French
soldier, now took us under his wing. He set a
number of his friends to hunt down the line, and
several civilians joined in the search, among whom
was our burly driver, who had got tired of waiting
for us at the café. As we were now seated in the
motor-car, and had accepted the owner's kind offer
to drive us back to St&nbsp;Aubin, we told our fat driver
that his services and that of the horse and cart
would not be required. Some one then came running
up to say that M.&nbsp;le Receveur des Impôts had been
found and was now at the Bureau.</p>

<p>The business of changing the French notes was
soon carried through, but the English silver could
not be changed, as the rate of exchange was a
matter on which discussion might have lasted the
whole afternoon.</p>

<p>When M.'s Brigade had finished their last lap we
in the motor-car were then able to proceed with
our commissions. The first stop was at the
chemist's. Picton-Warlow stayed in the car. The
chemist greeted me as an old friend, and I presently
recognised him to be one of the gentlemen who in
evening dress had taken part in the reception at
the Sous-préfecture. He was now standing at the
back of his shop in the middle of a group of stout,
middle-aged, and severely respectable-looking
citizens, to whom he was telling the story of the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_016" title="16"> </a>
day's adventure. After my arrival the conversation
came gradually round to a discussion of the Entente
Cordiale, and the alliance Franco-Ecossaise, until I
felt that a request to purchase tooth-paste would
be almost an indiscretion.</p>

<p>Outside, a crowd had again collected, and Picton-Warlow,
sitting unprotected in the back of the car,
was an object of respectful yet insistent curiosity.
Here was a chance to see "le kilt" at close quarters.
The good citizens (and citizenesses too) climbed on
to and into the car to see and feel "les jambes
nues! mais en hiver ça doit être terrible!"</p>

<p>Picton-Warlow refused to sit in the car at our
next stop, and so we went together into "Le Grand
Bazar." "Avez-vous des plumes, de l'encre, et du
papier à écrire?" "Mais ou, Monsieur, on va vous
faire voir cela tout de suite." And we were led
round the shop to inspect the trays wherein it is
the custom of bazaars to display their stock.</p>

<p>Simple-minded inhabitants of a wild and mountainous
region (les Hig-landerrs) are no doubt
unaccustomed to the splendour of bazaars, so the
shop-girls watched with expectant interest. Picton-Warlow
selected the best shaving-brush (this for
the Adjutant, whose kit had got lost) out of a tray
of very second-rate brushes with nothing of the
"Blaireau" about them except the name. "Tiens,"
said one of the girls, nudging another, "Il s'y connait,
le grand! Il a pris le meilleur du premier
<a class="pagenum" name="page_017" title="17"> </a>
coup!" "Mais parle donc pas si fort, je te dis
que 'l'autre' comprend." While "le grand"
was making his purchases, a French reservist,
the only other customer in the shop, looked on
with absorbing interest. The <i>brave poilu</i> could
no longer contain his curiosity, and began to
follow "le grand," pretending to take an interest
in the pens, ink, and paper. Just as "le grand"
was choosing an indelible pencil, the <i>poilu</i> ventured
to stretch out a hand and feel the texture
of his kilt. "Mais comme ils doivent avoir froid
en hiver! Les jambes nues," he said, addressing
me; and then as "le grand" turned round, "Pardon,
quel rang?" "Capitaine," said I in a solemn
voice. The <i>poilu</i> in horror stepped back a pace,
saluted "le grand." "Pardon, mon capitaine, je
ne savais pas." "L'autre qui comprend," then
explained the significance of stars and stripes,
and with great difficulty persuaded the abashed
and no longer curious soldier that we were not
in the least offended at his unintentional breach
of discipline.</p>

<p>We had to drive up to the barracks in order that
our driver could get his <i>permis de rentrée</i>, and, refusing
with regret the hospitality of the officer in
charge, we started off for St&nbsp;Aubin, arriving back
in time to pay out before night had fallen. Before
turning in I went down to the end of the village to
settle up with the fat innkeeper; we had a farewell
<a class="pagenum" name="page_018" title="18"> </a>
drink of wine, and I paid him five francs, his own
price, for the hire of Cocotte and the carriole.</p>

<p>The five officers of D&nbsp;Company were billeted
alongside H.Q., who were in the big house. Our
tiny cottage consisted of two small rooms adjoining
the kitchen, inhabited by an old couple,
who, when I came in that evening, were sitting
silently over the dying embers of the kitchen fire.
The picture of the old man, small of stature
and wizened in features, and very poor, is still
vivid in my mind. Life had left its mark
most distinctly upon him. One could see how
from early morning to late at night he had from
childhood toiled over the hard earth which had
drawn him down, until now his back was bent as
if still at labour, even when at rest by the fireside.
The two did not speak when I came in, but
sat watching the fire. No other light was in the
room. An occasional flicker from the hearth lit
up the walls of brown-coloured plaster, the clean
but badly-laid tiles, an old cupboard of polished
walnut, the kitchen table, also old, and black from
smoke and much polishing. I asked the old man if
he would wake me at four. "Mais oui, Monsieur,"
he replied, "nous nous coucherons pas, nous autres,
nous restons pour garder le feu, et si vous voulez de
l'eau chaude demain matin on vous en donnera."</p>

<p>These good Samaritans had provided beds for the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_019" title="19"> </a>
five of us, and they were to sit up and watch the
fire.</p>

<p>The bedroom next the kitchen contained no furniture
save the four beds, each of which was provided
with a straw mattress, but no sheets or blankets.
Captain Lumsden occupied a tiny room at
the back&mdash;so small that it was more cupboard than
a room. It was here that the old people slept.
The bed, which took up nearly the whole space,
was covered with clean white sheets and an eider-down
quilt, very new looking, as if they were used
only on special occasions. Lumsden would have
spread his valise on the floor had there been room,
as the bed was at least a foot too short for his long
limbs.</p>

<p>About an hour before dawn the old man came in
with a jug of hot water and a stump of candle.
After a very rapid shave, I hurried out into the
darkness with a little Chinese lantern bought at
the Grand Bazar.</p>

<p>We messed with H.Q. at the auberge just opposite,
and thither I went as assistant P.M.C. to
make sure breakfast would be ready. The oil-lamps
were lit in the long low room, and hot <i>café
au lait</i>, with round loaves of bread and <i>fromage
de Marolles</i>, had been laid on the table. A large
dish of steaming bacon came over from the cook's
fire, which was in the orchard behind H.Q. This
<a class="pagenum" name="page_020" title="20"> </a>
was the last substantial breakfast that any of us
were to get for many a long day.</p>

<p>All the marching had so far been done along
pleasant country roads through a country of hedges
and orchards, very like central and southern England.
But the aspect changed when, shortly after
leaving St&nbsp;Aubin, we reached the Route Nationale.
The battalion wheeled to the left, and we were
marching down one of the <i>chaussées pavées</i> which
are a special feature of Belgium and Northern
France. The <i>chaussée</i>, or centre of the
road, is paved with large uneven cobbles, on a
width of eight to ten yards. On each side of the
paved roadway a macadamised surface, about three
yards broad, slopes away at a steep camber to
the well-kept grass <i>accôtement</i>, which would be very
nice to walk on were it not for the narrow channels
every twenty or thirty yards draining to the
deep, clean ditch, which runs outside the line of
beautiful trees that flank both sides of the road.</p>

<p>We marched straight through the town of Maubeuge,
which was full of French soldiers of the
Territorial Reserve. The pavement in the town is
atrocious, and made my feet sore; the sun was
hotter than ever; the dust, being now largely coal-dust,
was more unpleasant than before. We halted
for a few minutes just beyond the bridge over the
railway, where British troops were unloading guns
from long lines of trucks. When I turned from
<a class="pagenum" name="page_021" title="21"> </a>
watching the station I found that my platoon had
got mixed up with a lot of French reservists, and
that an unofficial and very dangerous rifle inspection
was taking place, which was fortunately cut
short by the order to "Fall in" coming down from
the head of the column.</p>

<p>Shortly after crossing the railway the road turns
sharply to the right, past an antiquated bastion,
reminiscent of Vauban; by the roadside is a
finger-post pointing to Belgium. What we saw
on rounding the corner was strange, and at first
inexplicable: it was as if a tornado had visited the
spot. Where a row of cottages had been was now
a shapeless mass of ruins. The ground was covered
with huge trees lying across each other, the branches
fresh and green, the roots broken and torn as if by
some high explosive. The French had been clearing
a field of fire. Beyond the entanglement
of the fallen trees a network of barbed wire was
being laid on a depth of some two hundred yards.</p>

<p>About two miles out of the town we passed the
trench, of which rumour had reached us at our first
billets. At Taisnières we had heard that 15,000
people were digging trenches in front of Maubeuge!
The trench, deep and broad, stretched away on
both sides of the road as far as the eye could see,
and probably encircled the whole of Maubeuge.
The road itself was blocked by barbed-wire entanglements,
a space being left in the middle wide
<a class="pagenum" name="page_022" title="22"> </a>
enough for the passage of a single cart. In a wood
some few hundred yards behind the line of defence
was a very cleverly-hidden field fortification, in
which, no doubt, some of the famous 75&nbsp;mm. guns
were concealed.</p>

<p>All along the road for a distance of several miles
men were working hard to clear a field of fire,
hacking off branches, cutting off the tops of trees
and blowing some up by the roots. A field telephone
along the roadside connected these working
parties with the observation officer of the battery.</p>

<p>At 2.15, tired, hot and hungry, we entered
Joigny la Chaussée, a long straggling village, one
side of the road in Belgium, the other in France.</p>

<p>Dinner was a very poor affair that evening&mdash;thin,
watery soup with slices of bread soaked,
omelette stiffened with some ration bacon.</p>

<p>Next morning, while we were having breakfast
of café au lait and partly developed omelette, our
hostess bewailed lugubriously the prospect of a
German invasion, thus showing in the light of
subsequent events that she appreciated the military
situation far better than we did. "Ils vont tout
piller, tout prendre de ce que nous avons, ces
sauvages!"</p>

<p>On leaving Joigny la Chaussée we were back
again on the highroad, forming part of a long
column which was moving in the direction of
Mons, distant some ten to twelve miles. Our
<a class="pagenum" name="page_023" title="23"> </a>
enemies that morning, just as on the previous day,
were dust, cobble-stones, and the sun.</p>

<p>Shortly before midday the battalion halted at
a level crossing on the outskirts of Mons, and then
turned to the left down a side road which runs
along the railway line, opposite a small station.
The rest of the column marched on over the
railway and through the town.</p>

<p>We spent most of the afternoon waiting by the
roadside; the men sat down, some on the road,
some in the ditch on the railway side, all thirsty,
hot, and hungry. The inhabitants of the locality,
a straggling suburb, brought along some loaves
and cheese, which did not, however, go far among
so many. Then came a woman with two jugs of
what looked like wine and water. The first man
to reach her, instead of drinking the stuff, washed
his mouth with it and spat on to the road, and
all those who followed did the same. "They do
not seem to like it," said the woman as she passed
me with the empty jugs. "C'est pourtant très
rafraîchissant, de l'eau sucrée avec un peu de
menthe." Peppermint-water does not suit the
Scotch palate!</p>

<p>Captain Lumsden and I went off to search for an
estaminet to try to get something to eat, and we
had not far to go. But the new-found estaminet
did not lay itself out to supply anything but thin
beer and short drinks. However, we got two pork
<a class="pagenum" name="page_024" title="24"> </a>
cutlets and some eggs, and were sitting half-way
through this welcome meal when A&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;,
with some other officers, having discovered our
retreat, entered and ordered lunch, but with little
success. The two pork cutlets and six fried eggs
had apparently exhausted the resources of the
establishment, and the new-comers had to content
themselves with bread and butter, Dutch cheese,
and the thin mixture, yellow in colour, slightly
bitter to taste, which in this misguided locality
is called beer.</p>

<p>On getting back to the road we found that most
of the officers had settled down to sleep in the
ditch on one side of the road, and most of the
men followed their example on the other.</p>

<p>Train-loads of refugees, mostly women and children,
were continually passing through the station.</p>

<p>It was nearly four o'clock when at last the order
came to fall in. We marched back past the level-crossing
and followed the railway line for a short
way along a narrow paved road leading to the
little village of Hyon, situated on a hill immediately
to the right of Mons, where the Chateau de
Hyon overlooks the plains and stands out distinctly
in the picturesque landscape.</p>

<p>The sun had not long set when the men were
settled down in billets, and cooking-pots stood
smoking in the village street, where the afterglow
of sunset still held off the twilight.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_025" title="25"> </a>
Through the still air came the hum of an aeroplane,
which soon was floating over the village,
about 2000 feet above our heads, spying out
our position&mdash;unmolested and unafraid, the first
German Taube!</p>

</div>

<p>Quoted in the <i>Tatler</i>, Oct. 29, <span class="underline">1709.</span></p>

<p>The war of 1914 is in many ways an illustration
of Alison's remark that battle-grounds have a
tendency to repeat themselves, for to a student of
Marlborough's campaigns the whole battle-line of
Flanders is familiar. In 1709 the confederate
armies, British, Dutch, Prussian, under Marlborough,
numbering about 95,000 strong, succeeded
by rapid marches in cutting off Mons from the
French who were marching to its relief. After a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_026" title="26"> </a>
most sanguinary battle, which took place on the
11th September, the French were forced to retire.</p>

<p>Between 1709 and 1914 no military comparison
is possible owing to the new factors which have
entered into the operations of war. Moreover, in
1709 the opposing forces were approximately
equal. Still it is interesting to note that in 1709
the French, although beaten and compelled to
retire, suffered less, owing to the strength of their
position, than the confederate army, and that the
French retreat from Mons was accomplished in
perfect order.</p>

<p>The aspect of the country stretching northwards
beyond the village and woods of Hyon is probably
much the same to-day as when Marlborough's
troops camped there in the autumn of 1709.
From the dominating woods of Hyon the ground
slopes very gradually, and is divided into irregular
plots of cultivated ground, groups of farm buildings,
and patches of woodlands; farther down the
valley away to the right are some considerable
villages; near at hand on the left lies the town
of Mons, partly hidden from view by a piece of
rising ground.</p>

<p>On leaving billets at Hyon on Sunday, 23rd
August, each company marched out with separate
orders to take up the position to which it had been
detailed the night before, and it was about 6&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span>
when D company reached the appointed spot on
<a class="pagenum" name="page_027" title="27"> </a>
the main road from Mons. There had been
rain in the night; the sun was already high,
but as yet no summer haze impeded the distant
view. Vainly did field-glasses explore the country
for some sign of the enemy, and we little imagined
that through the far distant woods the Huns were
once more descending upon the Hainault. We,
resting in the shade of the long avenue of trees,
had not yet realised the imminence of great
events.</p>

<p>In the days of peace, when soldiering was mostly
confined to a man&oelig;uvring space on some open
heath, and the route-march along the King's highway,
the word "battlefield" had lost its meaning,
and was a contradiction in terms in its literal sense.
Fields were always "out of bounds." Since landing
in France we had not yet lost the fear of
cultivated ground, and at every halting-place precautions
were taken to prevent troops straying
off the highway; and when in billets, entrance
into orchards, gardens, and fields surrounding the
village was strictly forbidden. We had marched
along many miles of long straight dusty road
between the pleasant trees, and halted many times
by a roadside such as this, when nothing but a
shallow ditch and the conventions of soldiering
in peace time prevented our entry into potential
battlefields. The word of command to fall in
had for so many years been followed inevitably
<a class="pagenum" name="page_028" title="28"> </a>
by a simple "quick march," and so on to the
next halt.</p>

<p>Now, with the command "<i>left wheel</i>, quick
march," we left the straight road and entered
the cultivated fields, marching across a piece of
bare stubble, then over some thickly growing
beetroot still wet with dew, and again without
hindrance, for there was no fence on all the land;
across yet another plot of stubble up to the edge
of a large cabbage patch, where two sticks were
standing freshly cut, and stuck into the ground
as if to mark the stand for guns at a cover shoot.</p>

<p>In front the unencumbered ground, cultivated
in narrow strips, sloped evenly down to a main
road which crossed our front diagonally, and
formed an angle on the left, but out of sight,
with the road we had just left. At this point
the angle of the roads held by C&nbsp;Company on
our left flank was hidden from view by a piece
of rising ground. On the right flank and at a
lower level, No.&nbsp;14 platoon had already started
digging their trench in a stubble field: beyond
this, and in the same line, was a plantation of
tall trees, with thick undergrowth.</p>

<p>The Route Nationale, with its usual border of
poplar-trees, cuts diagonally across the patchwork
of roots, stubble, and meadow. The distance at
its nearest point to our trench, which is now
traced out on the edge of the cabbage field, is
<a class="pagenum" name="page_029" title="29"> </a>
just about 400 yards; 50 yards farther down to
the right, on the far side of the road, there is
a large white house.</p>

<p>Beyond the road the fields carry a heavy crop
of beetroot, but there is here no great width of
cultivated land. The irregular border of the
forest reaches in some places to within four or
five hundred yards of the road, forming a barrier
to the searching of a field-glass at 1000 yards from
our position. Away to the right the valley opens
out like a map, with villages dotted here and there
among green plantations in the middle distance,
and beyond a great rolling stretch of country
looking to the naked eye like some large barren
heath, but showing in the field-glass the patch-quilt
effect of innumerable tiny strips of variegated
cultivation.</p>

<p>On such a day as this, when the sun is shining
in the distant valley, while thick clouds above
shade and tone the light, one can see farther
yet to where fields and woods and villages fade
together in the blue distance, with here and
there a darker tone of shadow, and sometimes
the sparkle of sunlight on a distant roof.</p>

<p>There was nothing in all the prospect to give
the slightest hint of war. No traffic stirred down
the straight avenue of poplars; distant patches of
open country away to the right where the sun was
shining remained still and deserted. Overhead
<a class="pagenum" name="page_030" title="30"> </a>
the clouds had been gathering. The trench was
nearly completed, when the rain came suddenly
and with almost tropical force, blinding all view
of the landscape.</p>

<p>I determined to pass away the time with a visit
to the white house by the roadside, and at the
same time get a look at our trench from what
might soon be the enemy's point of view.</p>

<p>The village on the road and on our flank (half
left) consisted of a dozen houses. Every house
was shut up. The warm rain poured in torrents,
and the village appeared to be deserted. I turned
and walked slowly down the road towards the
white house.</p>

<p>I can still see in my mind's eye the picture of
this roadside inn as I saw it that morning, as none
will ever see it again.</p>

<p>The house stood back a little from the road;
two steps above the ground-level one entered the
estaminet, a large airy room, a long table down the
centre covered with a red-and-white check oilcloth.
Outside stood a number of iron tables and chairs on
each side of a sanded level space for playing bowls
or ninepins. Beyond this a garden, or rather series
of rose bowers, each with its seat, a green patch of
long grass in the centre, and high hedges on the
side nearest the road, and on the side nearest the
cultivated fields and the woods beyond. In one
of the rose bowers in the garden I found a sentry
<a class="pagenum" name="page_031" title="31"> </a>
peering through the hedge. I was struck with the
air of conviction with which, in answer to my
question, he said he had seen nothing. The tone
showed how convinced he was that this was
simply the old old game of morning man&oelig;uvres
and finish at lunch-time.</p>

<p>In my own mind such an impression was fast
fading. The barricaded silent village up the road
had helped to create a sense of impending tragedy.
But the mask of make-believe did not quite fall
from my eyes until I met the woman of the estaminet,
a woman who came out of the white house
weeping and complaining aloud, with her children
clinging to her skirt. Her words I have never
forgotten, though at the time I did not realise
the whole meaning they contained, nor that this
woman's words were the protest of a nation.</p>

<p>The Germans were close at hand, she said, and
would destroy everything. What was to be done,
where was she to flee for safety? Her frightened,
sobbing voice, and the frightened faces of the
children, these were, indeed, the first signs of war!
I told her the truth that I knew nothing, and could
give no advice as to whether it was safe to stay
or flee, and as I left the tidy sanded garden and
stepped on to the main road she raised her voice
again with prophetic words: "What have we
done, we poor people, 'paisible travailleurs'?
What have we done that destruction should now
<a class="pagenum" name="page_032" title="32"> </a>
fall upon our heads? Qu'est ce que nous avons
fait de mal!"</p>

<p>The warm sunshine was pleasant after the rain.
Not a sign of life on the long straight road. Four
hundred yards away a soldier was still planting
cabbages along the top of our parapet. I watched
his work for a moment through my field-glasses,
and then turned and looked across the road at the
thick undergrowth beyond the cultivated ground.
If the woman of the estaminet was right, even now
those woods might conceal a German scout.</p>

<p>If at the time such a thought passed through my
mind, it scarcely obtained a moment's consideration,
so difficult it was then to realise the change
that had already come upon the world. How incredible
it is now that at the last moment of peace
the prospect of real fighting could have still seemed
so remote.</p>

<p>Somewhere hidden in the memory of all who
have taken part in the war there is the remembrance
of a moment which marked the first realisation
of the great change&mdash;the moment when
material common things took on in real earnest
their military significance, when, with the full comprehension
of the mind, a wood became cover for
the enemy, a house a possible machine-gun position,
and every field a battlefield.</p>

<p>Such an awakening came to me when sitting on
the roadside by the White Estaminet. The sound
<a class="pagenum" name="page_033" title="33"> </a>
of a horse galloping and the sight of horse and
rider, the sweat and mud and the tense face of the
rider bending low by the horse's neck, bending as
if to avoid bullets. The single rider, perhaps bearing
a despatch, followed after a short space by a
dozen cavalrymen, not galloping these, but trotting
hard down the centre of the road, mud-stained,
and also with tense faces. A voice crying out
above the rattle of hoofs on the roadway: "Fall
back and join H.Q."</p>

<p>Now that the sound of cavalry had passed away
the road was quiet again. There was no stir
around the white house, no peasants or children
to see the soldiers, no stir in the fields and woods
beyond.</p>

<p>Behind the closed shutters of the white house
the tearful woman of the estaminet listened in
terror to the sound of horses' hoofs, and crouched
in the silence that followed. I returned slowly
across the drenched fields filled with the new realisation
that this trench of ours was "the front."</p>

<p>The trench, three feet deep and not much more
that eighteen inches broad, formed a gradual curve
thirty to forty yards in length, and sheltered three
sections of the platoon. The fourth section was
entrenched on higher ground a hundred yards back,
protecting our left flank.</p>

<p>At some distance to the rear stood a pile of
faggots, which we laid out in a straight line and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_034" title="34"> </a>
covered with a sprinkling of earth to form a dummy
trench.</p>

<p>The dinners were served out and the dixies
carried away, still in peace. The quiet fields and
woods, with the sun now high in the heavens,
seemed to contradict the idea of war. Searching
round the edge of every wood, searching in turn
each field and road, my field-glasses could find no
sign of troops, and nothing disturbed the Sunday
morning calm. Then, far away, a mile or more
along the border of a wood, I saw the grey uniforms.</p>

<p>A small body of troops, not more than a platoon,
showed up very badly against the dark background;
even as I looked again they had disappeared among
the trees. To the left of the white house, beyond
the road and beyond the beetroot fields, the thick
brushwood which skirts the cultivated ground
becomes more open, and here the sun throws a
gleam of light. Here, it seemed, were many
shadows. At that moment German snipers, unknown
to us, were already lying somewhere on
the edge of the wood. The sound of bullets is
most alarming when wholly unexpected. Those
German scouts must have been using telescopic
sights, for they managed to put a couple of bullets
between Sergeant Lee and myself. Still more
unexpected and infinitely more terrifying was the
tremendous explosion from <i>behind</i>, which knocked
<a class="pagenum" name="page_035" title="35"> </a>
me into the bottom of the trench, for the moment
paralysed with fright.</p>

<p>The battery behind the woods of Hyon had fired
its first range-finding shell rather too low, and the
shot ricochetted off a tree on the road behind our
trenches.</p>

<p>The situation in front of the trenches had not
yet changed, as far as one could see, since the first
shot was fired. An occasional bullet still flicked
by, evidently fired at very long range.</p>

<p>The corner house of the hamlet six to seven
hundred yards to our left front was partly hidden
from view by a hedge. The cover afforded by
this house, the hedge and the ditch which ran
alongside it, began to be a cause of anxiety. If
the enemy succeeded in obtaining a footing either
in the house itself or the ditch behind the hedge,
our position would be enfiladed.</p>

<p>One of my men who had been peering over the
trench through two cabbage stalks, proclaimed
that he saw something crawling along behind this
hedge. A prolonged inspection with the field-glasses
revealed that the slow-moving, dark-grey body
belonged to an old donkey carelessly and lazily
grazing along the edge of the ditch. The section
of my platoon who were in a small trench to our
left rear, being farther away and not provided with
very good field-glasses, suddenly opened rapid fire
on the hedge and the donkey disappeared from
<a class="pagenum" name="page_036" title="36"> </a>
view. This little incident caused great amusement
in my trench, the exploit of No.&nbsp;4 section in successfully
despatching the donkey was greeted with roars
of laughter and cries of "Bravo the donkey killers,"
all of which helped to relieve the tension.</p>

<p>It was really the donkey that made the situation
normal again. Just before there had been some
look of anxiety in men's faces and much unnecessary
crouching in the bottom of the trench.
Now the men were smoking, watching the shells,
arguing as to the height at which they burst over
our heads, and scrambling for shrapnel bullets.</p>

<p>The German shells came in bunches; some burst
over the road behind, others yet farther away
crashed into the woods of Hyon. At the same
time the rattle of one of our machine-guns on the
left and the sound of rapid rifle fire from the same
quarter showed that C&nbsp;Company had found a target,
while as yet we peered over our trenches in vain.
I will not pretend to give an account of the battle
of Mons, "because you have better in the prints,"
and because my confused recollection of what took
place during the rest of the afternoon will not permit
of recounting in their due order even events
which took place on our small part of the front.
The noise of bursting shells, the sound of hard
fighting on our left, must have endured for nearly
an hour before any attempt was made by the
Germans, now swarming in the wood behind the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_037" title="37"> </a>
white house, to leave cover and make an attack
on our front. From the farthest point of the wood,
at a range of 1200 yards, a large body of troops
marched out into the open in column, moving across
our front to our left flank, evidently for the purpose
of reinforcing the attack on C&nbsp;Company.</p>

<p>At 1200 yards rifle fire, even at such a target, is
practically useless. It was impossible to resist the
temptation to open fire with the hope of breaking
up the column formation and thus delaying
the reinforcement operations. "No.&nbsp;1 Section, at
1200 yards, three rounds rapid." I bent over the
parapet, glasses fixed on the column. They were
not quite clear of the wood and marching along
as if on parade.</p>

<p>At the first volley the column halted, some of the
men skipped into the wood, and most of them
turned and faced in our direction. With the
second and third volleys coming in rapid succession
they rushed in a body for cover.</p>

<p>All our shots seemed to have gone too high and
none found a billet, but the enemy made no further
attempt to leave the wood in close formation, but
presently advanced along the edge of the wood in
single file, marching in the same direction as before,
and affording no target at such a distance.</p>

<p>Various descriptions of the battle of Mons speak
of the Germans advancing like grey clouds covering
the earth, of "massed formation" moving across
<a class="pagenum" name="page_038" title="38"> </a>
the open to within close range of our trenches, to
be decimated by "murderous fire."</p>

<p>On every extended battle line incidents will occur
affording opportunities for picturesque writing, but
in the attack and defence of an open position in the
days of pre-trench war, excepting always the noise
of bursting shells, the hum of bullets and the absence
of umpires, the whole affair is a passable imitation of
a field-day in peace time.</p>

<p>Our position at Hyon, important because it
dominated the line of retreat, was weakly held.
We had practically no supports. The German
superiority at that part of the line was probably
about three to one in guns, and five or more to
one in men.</p>

<p>The enemy attacked vigorously, met with an
unexpectedly vigorous resistance, hesitated, failed
to push their action home, and lost an opportunity
which seldom occurred again&mdash;an opportunity
which has now gone for ever.</p>

<p>With half the determination shown at Verdun
the Germans could have captured our position with
comparatively trifling loss, turned our flank, and
disorganised the preparation for retreat.</p>

<p>The steady hammer of one of our machine-guns
and a renewed burst of rapid fire from the rifles
of C&nbsp;Company made it clear that an attack on
the village was in progress. Then the battery
whose first shell had nearly dropped into our trench
<a class="pagenum" name="page_039" title="39"> </a>
put their second shot neatly on to the red-tiled
house at the left-hand corner of the village.</p>

<p>A shell bursting over a village! Who would pay
attention now to such a detail when whole villages
are blown into the air all along a thousand miles of
battle?</p>

<p>Twenty feet above the red tiles a double flash
like the twinkling of a great star, a graceful puff
of smoke, soft and snow-white like cotton-wool.
In that second the red tiles vanished and nothing
of the roof remained but the bare rafters.</p>

<p>Now our guns were searching out the German
artillery positions, and sent shell after shell far
over our heads on to the distant woods; and
now the German shells, outnumbering ours by
two or three to one, were bursting all along the
woods behind our trenches and behind the main
road. The noise of what was after all a very
mild bombardment seemed very terrible to our
unaccustomed ears!</p>

<p>Still the rattle of a machine-gun on our left;
but the bursts of rifle fire were less prolonged and
at rarer intervals, so that the pressure of the
German attack was apparently relaxing. The
surprise of the day came from our right flank.</p>

<p>Here the main road ran across and away diagonally
from our line, so that the amount of open
ground in front of No.&nbsp;14 Trench was considerably
nearer 600 than 400 yards&mdash;the whole distance
<a class="pagenum" name="page_040" title="40"> </a>
from this trench to the road being bare
pasture-land, with scarcely cover for a rabbit.
No.&nbsp;14 Trench extends to within a few yards
of the thick plantation which runs almost parallel
with our line. The cover is not much more than
two or three acres in extent, and on the far side
of the wood the line is carried on by another
company.</p>

<p>I was on the point of laying down my glasses,
having made a final sweep of the ground, including
a look down to No.&nbsp;14 Trench, when something
caught my attention in the plantation, and at
that same moment a body of troops in extended
order dashed out of the woods and doubled across
the open meadow. The sight of these men,
coming apparently from behind our own line
and making at such speed for the enemy, was
so entirely unexpected that, although their uniforms
even at the long range seemed unfamiliar,
I did not realise they were Germans. A volley
from No.&nbsp;14 Trench put an end to uncertainty.
The line broke, each man running for safety at
headlong speed; here and there a man, dropping
backwards, lay still on the grass.</p>

<p>In the centre of the line the officer, keeping
rather behind the rest, stumbled and fell. The
two men nearest him stopped, bent down to
assist him, looking for a moment anxiously into
his face as he lay back on the grass, then quickly
<a class="pagenum" name="page_041" title="41"> </a>
turned and ran for cover. A very few seconds
more and the remaining racing figures dodged
between trees on the main road and found
safety.</p>

<p>When the rifle fire ceased, two or three of the
grey bodies dotted about the field were seen to
move; one or two rose up, staggered a few paces,
only to fall at once and lie motionless; other
two or three wriggled and crawled away; and
one rose up apparently unhurt, running in zigzag
fashion, dodging from side to side with sudden
cunning, though no further shot was fired.</p>

<p>The German attack now began to press on
both flanks&mdash;on the left perhaps with less vigour,
but on the right an ever-increasing intensity of
rifle fire seemed to come almost from behind our
trenches; but on neither left nor right could anything
be seen of the fighting. The ceaseless tapping
of our two machine-guns was anxious hearing
during that long afternoon, and in the confusion of
bursting shells the sound of busy rifles seemed to
be echoing on all sides.</p>

<p>Three German officers stepped out from the
edge of the wood behind the white house; they
stood out in the open, holding a map and discussing
together the plan of attack. The little
group seemed amazingly near in the mirror of
my field-glass, but afforded too hopelessly small
a target for rifle fire at a 1000 yards' range. The
<a class="pagenum" name="page_042" title="42"> </a>
conference was, however, cut short by a shell
from our faithful battery behind the wood of
Hyon. A few minutes later, the officers having
skipped back into cover, a long line of the now
familiar grey coats advanced slowly about ten yards
from the wood and lay down in the beetroot
field; an officer, slightly in front of his men,
carrying a walking-stick and remaining standing
until another shell threw him on to his face
with the rest.</p>

<p>Our shells were bursting splendidly beyond the
white house, with now and then a shell on what
had once been the red-tiled corner house, and now
and then a shell into the woods beyond where the
German reserves were sheltering.</p>

<p>Two or three lines of supports issued forth from
the wood, and the first line pushed close up to the
white house; but as long as we could see to
shoot, and while our shells were sprinkling the
fields with shrapnel, the enemy failed to reach
their objective and suffered heavy casualties.</p>

<p>After the sun had set the vigour of the fight
was past, and in the twilight few shells were
exchanged from wood to wood, although machine-guns
still drummed and rifles cracked, keeping
the enemy from further advance. And now, far
in the distant valley&mdash;perhaps fifteen or twenty
miles away&mdash;the smoke of exploding shells hung
in white puffs on the horizon, and the red flame
<a class="pagenum" name="page_043" title="43"> </a>
of fire showed here and there a burning village
in the wake of the French Army.</p>

<p>General French had by now received the news
of the retreat from Charleroi, and the retreat of
the British Army was in hasty preparation; but
from us all such great doings were hidden.</p>

<p>Although it was now too dark for accurate shooting&mdash;for
even the road and the white house were
fading into the dusk&mdash;we had selected a certain
number of outstanding marks easily seen in the
twilight: a stump of a tree, a low bush, and a low
white wall&mdash;points which the enemy would have to
cross should they attempt to approach the house
from the left flank. A remnant of the twilight
remained when the Germans left the cover of the
beetroot field, and with my field-glasses I could
just manage to see when they passed in front of
our prearranged targets, to see also the sudden
hail of bullets spatter on the road and against
the white wall among leaping, dodging shadows.
On the right the machine-gun was silent for a
space. In front dead silence round the familiar
shadows of the white house. Then a voice
broke out of the darkness, and a sound as of
hammering on wooden doors. What followed,
and what atrocious deed was committed in the
night, none can ever surely tell.</p>

<p>The voice shouted again, "Frauen und Kinder
heraus!" No description can convey the horror
<a class="pagenum" name="page_044" title="44"> </a>
of this voice from the dark, the brutal bullying
tone carrying to our ears an instant apprehension.
More hammering, and then a woman's
screams&mdash;the brutal voice and piercing screams
as of women being dragged along, and the
French voice of a man loudly protesting, with
always the hard staccato German words of command;
then yet another louder shrieking, then
three rifle-shots, and a long silence. A long
silence, and never more in the night did we
hear the man's protesting voice or the terrified
shriek of women.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by leaping, crackling
flames, and in an instant the white house was
a roaring bonfire. Fiercely danced the flames,
carrying high into the night their tribute to
German efficiency!</p>

<p>During the long silence after the three shots,
we had all seen with eyes straining through the
darkness, how shadows were at work round the
walls, and one shadow on the roof whose errand
there was at first a mystery, but was quickly explained
in the light of the great blaze which rose
up instantaneously from a spark kindled in the
darkness of the courtyard.</p>

<p>In the ring of light thrown by the blazing house,
the trees on the roadside, the out-houses beyond
the courtyard, and even, for a short way, the beetroot
fields, showed vividly against the black arch
<a class="pagenum" name="page_045" title="45"> </a>
of night. Here, on the fringe of light in uncertain
mist of mingled smoke and darkness, it seemed
as if men were grouped revelling over the night's
work. Now that the roof had fallen in, clouds
of smoke hung low over the fields and the red-hot
glow gave little light. Only every now and
then a flame, shooting high into the thick darkness,
threw a momentary gleam on a wider arch and
showed the black shadows of men dodging back
into the safety of the night.</p>

<p>The work was well and quickly done. The
pleasant roadside inn where I had idly wandered
in the morning was now a smouldering ruin.</p>

<p>There is no excuse for this ruin of a Belgian
home. The burning was deliberate, and carried
out with military precision under orders given by
the officer in command, serving no conceivable
military purpose, and prompted solely by a spirit
of wanton destruction.</p>

<p>The story of the three shots in the dark will,
perhaps, never be clearly told, but there can be
little doubt&mdash;there is none in the minds of those
who heard&mdash;that both the women and the man
were brutally murdered.</p>

<p>Nearly a thousand years ago this same land was
laid waste by the Huns, who left a memory that
has lasted down to the hour of their return, for
"it is in memory of the Huns," says an ancient
chronicle, "that the province received the name
<a class="pagenum" name="page_046" title="46"> </a>
of Hanonia or Hainault," a name which it retains
to this day.</p>

<p>Again, after a thousand years, the Huns have
risen and left a track in Europe for the memory
of many generations.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_047" title="47"> </a>
CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="small">THE RETREAT.</span></h2>


<p>Captain Picton-Warlow came up and whispered
the order to retire. We had lain for many
hours in front of our trench with bayonets fixed,
expecting an attack at any moment, finding alarm
in every shadow and fear in the rustling of night
breezes.</p>

<p>There was safety for a time on the main road,
and relief in the companionable formation of fours
from the isolation and responsibility of trenches.</p>

<p>During the few moments' halt before marching
down the road we heard how C&nbsp;Company
had suffered heavy casualties. Major Simpson&mdash;reported
mortally wounded. Lieut. Richmond&mdash;killed.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards down the road a machine-gun
flashed red in the darkness; just before reaching
it we turned down a side road to the right and
joined on to the rest of the battalion. Here, by the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_048" title="48"> </a>
roadside, close up against a grassy bank, a number
of men were resting, some huddled up, others
lying quite still. Almost at once the battalion
moved on again, leaving the kilted figures by the
roadside.</p>

<p>Less than an hour after leaving the main road
we halted on a steep hillside meadow. The order
was given to lie down, and for the two or three
hours of the remaining night the companies slept
on the field in column of fours.</p>

<p>The sloping hillside where we had spent the
night breaks at its crest and drops steeply down
to the village of Nouvelle, and the rich pasture-land
with tall poplar-trees in ordered array. Beyond
the ground rises suddenly, with patches of
cultivation sloping up to the skyline in gentle
undulations. Twenty yards below the crest of the
hill, three hundred yards from a small plantation,
two field-guns lay abandoned in the open. D&nbsp;Company,
posted two hundred yards from the
village, were scraping into some sort of cover by
the roadside, when a well-timed shell burst right
between the two guns, followed by half a dozen
more along the ridge of the hill. The enemy was
ranging the village, and soon two shells burst
among the poplar-trees close to our "trenches,"
now six inches deep into the hard chalk rock.</p>

<p>We left the village just in time. Marching
through the empty street between the shuttered
<a class="pagenum" name="page_049" title="49"> </a>
houses I caught a glimpse of the two abandoned
field-guns, and of a team of horses galloping along
the ridge under the blazing shells. The guns were
saved, but I never heard if the two gallant riders
obtained recognition of their gallant deed.</p>

<p>For several miles our road ran alongside the
railway and through open country. Pleasant in the
cool morning air, and peaceful until about 9&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span>,
when the enemy began to shell the road from the
wooded hills on our right flank. The battalion
then crossed the railway, and two companies
entrenched across a wide stretch of open pasture,
facing the direction in which we had been marching,
protected from the right to some extent by
the railway embankment.</p>

<p>The enemy occupied a position among slag-heaps
and factory chimneys about 4000 yards to
our front, and as our own guns were only 200 yards
behind, the noise of the artillery duel was prodigious.
On this occasion the heavy guns from
Maubeuge did very useful work. The big shells
could actually be seen sailing along like monster
torpedoes, and at each explosion among the slag-heaps
an enormous cloud of dust rose into the air.</p>

<p>Our trenches possessed few of the desiderata
carefully laid down in the Field Service pocket-book.
The parapet was far from bullet-proof, the
bright yellow clay against the green must have
been visible for more than a mile, and the average
<a class="pagenum" name="page_050" title="50"> </a>
depth of the trench was certainly not more than
a foot. Shells were bursting here and there, sometimes
far in front, now far behind, along the railway
line and only occasionally over the trench, for the
Huns had not yet succeeded in locating our battery.
Probably they were somewhat disturbed by the
"Jack Johnsons" from Maubeuge. At eleven
o'clock our guns retired and we followed suit,
each platoon retiring independently. While
No.&nbsp;13 re-formed along a high wall surrounding
the woods and garden of a small chateau about a
quarter of a mile behind the trench, we had a
narrow escape from disaster, as a shell landed
just beyond the wall, killing two men and some
horses.</p>

<p>We marched to Bavai without further incident,
entering the town soon after dark. Here was all
the confusion of retreat. Heavy motor-waggons,
some French transport, staff officers' cars with
blinding headlights, and vehicles of every description
obstructed our progress through the town.
I remember seeing a London taxi, one of the
W.G.'s, loaded with ammunition-boxes.</p>

<p>A mile outside the town we turned into an
orchard and bivouacked for the night, first dining
on strong tea and a ration biscuit.</p>

<p>There was vigour and cheerfulness in the warm
sunrise, and the battalion quickened its step and
recovered its usual cheery spirit as we left the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_051" title="51"> </a>
woods and entered the open country, marching
down a narrow macadamised road, avoiding the
horrors of the paved Route National. Later on in
the morning, one of the first duels between a British
and a German aeroplane took place right over the
road. The Taube, at about 4000 feet, was then following
our march, having not yet observed, as we
had, 7000 to 8000 feet up among the clouds, a tiny
speck, gradually growing bigger. Then the Taube
took alarm and turned at full speed for the German
lines. The speck, now seen to be a British aeroplane,
dropped straight down to within a few
hundred feet of the German machine, which was
circling and dodging at various angles, striving in
vain to escape. A puff of smoke from the British
machine sent the enemy crashing to the ground.</p>

<p>Along the dusty road, marching in the hot sun
with no knowledge of our destination or reason
for such incessant toil, halting for short minutes,
enough to ease the pack and rest the rifle and
then on again, until the alternate marching and
halting becomes the whole occupation not only of
the body but of the mind&mdash;the eye finds no charm
in pleasant countryside, and the mind gathers few
pictures; the endless road, the choking dust, the
unvaried pace in the hot sun.</p>

<p>On again through paved country towns where
the hard stones are hot to weary feet, down to
peaceful villages in fresh green valleys and up the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_052" title="52"> </a>
long steep slope on the far side and again on, now
across open country, now through the shade of
green woods. Here by the village pond a pedestrian
might well sit a while and smoke his pipe, watching
the children paddle in the brown water under the
shade of ancient trees. Often a glimpse through
open doors showed cool tiled kitchens with peasants
at the midday meal. Many shops in the village
street were closed, with the reason therefor chalked
across the shutters, "Fermé pour cause de Mobilisation."
At the Mairie, and sometimes at street
corners, large yellow posters, still fresh and clean,
called reservists to arms in the name of La République.</p>

<p>We found many such towns and villages, with
groups of men and women outside the numerous
estaminets, offering bottles of beer and wine,
or cigarettes; others with large buckets of wine and
water. Glasses of wine and water were quickly
seized, emptied in a few steps, handed back to
some spectator farther down the line, and passed
back again to the wine buckets.</p>

<p>There had been some thunder early in the
afternoon, and overhead the storm-clouds were
lowering.</p>

<p>Another long weary climb along the straight
dusty road to reach a large open plateau, where
an advance-guard of the 4th Division was entrenching,
for during all that day of our long march the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_053" title="53"> </a>
4th Division was detraining, and part of this force
took up a position north of Solesmes.</p>

<p>Large drops of rain were falling as we reached
the crest of the hill, and soon a smart shower
cleaned the road of dust, giving a new coolness to
the air and a new vigour to the weary column.</p>

<p>After the long lonely road it was heartening to
see the British troops, a mere handful of men,
making ready against the vast armies of Germany,
whose advance-guard were now hard on our heels.</p>

<p>That afternoon and all that night the 4th Division,
newly landed from England, fighting odds of
at least ten to one, held off the German advance,
and then rejoined the line of battle in the hours
between midnight and dawn.</p>

<p>Many months later a prisoner at Würzburg, an
officer of the King's Own (4th Division), told me
a story of that night's battle. When leaving the
village of Bethancourt, fighting every foot along
the village street in the darkness of the night, with
the Germans pouring in at the far side of the village,
Lt. Irvine and Sergeant &mdash;&mdash; entered a house
where one of their men had been carried mortally
wounded. They went to an upstairs room where
the dying soldier had been carried. Irvine was at
the foot of the stairs and Sergeant &mdash;&mdash; still busied
with the wounded soldier, when a violent knocking
was heard at the street door. Just as the door
burst open and the Germans were pouring in and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_054" title="54"> </a>
up the stairs, the Sergeant came unarmed out on
to the landing. Sergeant &mdash;&mdash; was a big powerful
man, who had held a heavy-weight boxing championship.
Without a moment's hesitation he picked
up a big sofa which happened to be close beside him
on the landing and crashed it down on the head of
the nearest German, breaking his neck and throwing
those behind him into a confused mass at the foot
of the stairs. Irvine emptied his revolver into the
struggling mass, the Sergeant dropped over the
banisters, and both escaped unharmed through
the back of the house. Sergeant &mdash;&mdash; was killed
in the trenches next morning.</p>

<p>Now that the 4th Division lay between ourselves
and the enemy, a halt was made on the slope of
a long straight hill, and the cooks began to serve
out dinner. It was half-past five. The rain poured
heavily. Major Duff and I sat by the roadside
comparing notes and searching for a solution of
our continued retreat. We knew nothing then of
von Kluck's attempt to outflank the French army.</p>

<p>For the first time since we had left Bavai a
motor-car came down the road, making in the
direction of the 4th Division, and going dead slow,
as the tired men lying on both sides of the road
left little enough space in the centre. The driver
stopped and shared our wet seat on the bank. It
was a strange meeting for the three of us. Now
Duff and I sought information from this driver
<a class="pagenum" name="page_055" title="55"> </a>
friend of ours, a distinguished member of the
House of Commons, acting as Intelligence Officer,
and this was the answer to our inquiry: "We
are drawing the Germans on!"</p>

<p>Three or four shabby cottages and a whitewashed
estaminet stand by the roadside on top of the hill,
overlooking the valley of the Sambre.</p>

<p>A few miles farther on, where a road branches
off from the main road to Cambrai, and curls
down the face of a steep hillside, Solesmes, hidden
in the valley, shows the top of a church spire.
The householders of Solesmes were putting up
their shutters as we passed through the town,
and less than an hour later shells were bursting
over the pleasant valley.</p>

<p>Not many miles away to the left lies Landrecies,
which R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson refers to, in 'An Inland
Voyage,' as "a point in the great warfaring system
of Europe which might on some future day be
ranged about with cannon, smoke, and thunder."
That evening the prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Caudry was reached at dusk, and here we heard
the welcome news that our billets were close at
hand. For two more miles along a narrow road,
through the soaking rain, the battalion dragged
slowly along. During the long twenty-five miles
from Bavai to Caudry, the longest day of the
retreat, very few men had fallen out; though all
were weary through want of food and sleep, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_056" title="56"> </a>
many feet were blistered and bleeding, every man
had kept his pack and greatcoat. The column
slept that night crowded under the humble roofs
of Audencourt.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the chill light of dawn trenches were being
dug outside the village. The line to be held by
the battalion extended as far as Caudry, and the
position of No.&nbsp;13 platoon was about half-way
between Audencourt and Caudry, close to a small
square-shaped plantation. The rear of my platoon
had just cleared the wood when a shell burst
overhead, and we had the unpleasant experience
of digging trenches under fire.</p>

<p>When at last we were under cover the shelling
ceased, having caused no casualties at our end of
the line, although some damage had been done up
among the leading platoon, now entrenched about
500 yards to our left, their left resting on
Caudry.</p>

<p>From information received long afterwards, the
explanation of this early morning attack is as
follows: German scouts had, on the previous
evening, already located our position in the village
of Audencourt, and a battery, placed behind Petit
Caudry either during the night or very early
in the morning, had ranged the little square-shaped
wood from the map, and as soon as their
observation man, who was probably in the church
<a class="pagenum" name="page_057" title="57"> </a>
tower at Bethancourt, saw No.&nbsp;13 platoon
marching past the wood, he signalled to the guns
to open fire. (These guns were almost at once
driven away by the troops occupying the village
of Caudry.)</p>

<p>The ground in front of our trenches slopes
gently down to the Route Nationale Caudry&mdash;Le
Cateau, which at this point runs on an embankment
and is lined with fine old poplar-trees. This
road was our first-range mark&mdash;350 yards.</p>

<p>Beyond the road the ground rises at a fairly
steep slope to the village of Bethancourt.</p>

<p>At the edge of the village, on the ridge of the
hill, the gate-post of a small paddock was our
second-range mark&mdash;900 yards. Between the
Route Nationale and the village the land is open
pasture, so that no accurate ranges could be taken
between 400 and 900 yards. The ridge of the hill
runs at a slightly decreasing slope down to a small
wood; on the right of this is a stubble field,
and to the right again, on the far ridge of the
hill, are beetroot fields through which a telephone
wire runs, the range being 1200 yards. Caudry
was on our left, with the houses of Petit Caudry
just visible on our left front; on our right the
village of Audencourt, with two platoons entrenched
strongly. Behind lay open country,
stretching back about 400 to 500 yards to the
road between Caudry and Audencourt; again
<a class="pagenum" name="page_058" title="58"> </a>
beyond that for at least half a mile open country
interspersed with small thickets.</p>

<p>For nearly half an hour after the shelling ceased
the countryside resumed its usual aspect. First
the church tower of Bethancourt, then house by
house, the village itself came into the full light of
the rising sun, whose rays soon reached our newly
dug trench to cheer us with their summer warmth.
Captain Lumsden came along to supervise the
clearing of a field of fire between our end of the
line and the Route Nationale.</p>

<p>Our trench was dug in a stubble field where the
corn had just been stooked, and it was now our
business to push all the stooks over. This gave
occasion for a great display of energy and excitement.
When the stooks had been laid low we
made a very poor attempt to disguise the newly
thrown-up earth by covering the top of the
trenches with straw, which only seemed to make
our position more conspicuous than ever. The
trench was lined with straw, and we cut seats and
made various little improvements. Then our guns
began to speak.</p>

<p>At the corner of the village of Bethancourt there
stands (or stood that morning) a farmhouse. In
the adjacent paddock two cows were peacefully
browsing. The first shell burst right above them.
They plunged and kicked and galloped about, but
soon settled down again to graze. Several shells
<a class="pagenum" name="page_059" title="59"> </a>
hit the church tower; the fifth or sixth set fire
to a large square white house near the church on
the right. Our gunners made good practice at the
two cows, and shell after shell burst over or near
their paddock, from which they finally escaped to
gallop clumsily along the ridge of the hill and
disappear into the wood, no doubt carrying bits
of shrapnel along with them. For at least half
an hour our guns had everything to themselves,
and it must have been a most unpleasant half-hour
for those who were on "the other side of the
hill."</p>

<p>About 9&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span> the German artillery got to work.
Many attempts have been made to describe the
situation in a trench while an artillery duel is in
progress, but really no words can give any idea
of the intensity of confusion. On both our flanks
machine-guns maintained a steady staccato. All
other sounds were sudden and nerve-straining,
especially the sudden rush of the large German
shell followed by the roar of its explosion in the
village of Audencourt, where dust and <i>débris</i> rise
like smoke from a volcano, showing the enemy
that the target has been hit.</p>

<p>The Huns evidently suspected that the little
wood on our right rear is being used to conceal
artillery, for they dropped dozens of shells into it,
doing no harm to anything but the trees. The
noise of the shells bursting among the branches
<a class="pagenum" name="page_060" title="60"> </a>
just behind us was most disturbing. Sometimes
these shells pitched short of the wood; they were
then less noisy, but far more unpleasant in other
respects. Just when the uproar was at its highest
a scared face appeared over the back of my
trench and stated that four ammunition boxes
lay at the far corner of the wood at our disposal,
please. The owner of the face, having delivered
his message, rose up and returned whence he had
come, doubled up yet running at great speed.</p>

<p>By about ten o'clock it became obvious that
the artillery duel was not to be decided in our
favour, and, moreover, that it would not as at
Mons end in a draw. I counted the number of
shells going south and north; the proportion was
about 7 to 1.</p>

<p>Gradually the number of our own shells grew
less and less as our batteries were silenced or
forced, or perhaps ordered, to retire. As this
went on it became evident&mdash;far more evident
than at Mons&mdash;that we were up against overwhelming
odds. The rush of shells reached a
maximum, and then for a space there was silence.
Pipes and cigarettes, up to now smoked only
by the fearless ones, for a short time appeared
on every side, and conversational remarks were
shouted from one trench to another. The respite
was brief, and its explanation at once obvious
when a Taube came sailing above our line considerably
<a class="pagenum" name="page_061" title="61"> </a>
out of rifle-shot. It did not need great
skill or experience in war to know what might
now be expected. The aeroplane came over early
in the afternoon, and less than half an hour after
it disappeared the German artillery reopened fire.</p>

<p>This time the wood and the village were spared,
for the Huns had silenced our guns and obtained
exact knowledge of the position of our trenches,
over which their shells now began to explode.</p>

<p>The German infantry first came into view crossing
the beetroot fields on top of the hill on our
right front, where the telegraph poles acted as the
1200 yards' mark. Through these fields they advanced
in close formation until disturbed by the
attentions of a machine-gun either of ours or of
the Royal Scots (who were holding the other side
of the village of Audencourt). It was not long
before we had a chance of getting rid of some
ammunition. German troops, debouching from
the little wood where the cows had taken refuge
earlier in the day, now advanced across the stubble
field on top of the hill, moving to their left flank
across our front. My glasses showed they were
extended to not more than two paces, keeping a
very bad line, evidently very weary and marching
in the hot sun with manifest disgust.</p>

<p>The command, "Five rounds rapid at the stubble
field 900 yards," produced a cinematographic picture
in my field-glasses. The Germans hopped
<a class="pagenum" name="page_062" title="62"> </a>
into cover like rabbits. Some threw themselves
flat behind the corn stooks, and when the firing
ceased got up and bolted back to the wood. Two or
three who had also appeared to fling themselves
down, remained motionless.</p>

<p>The enemy, having discovered that we could be
dangerous even at 900 yards, then successfully
crossed the stubble field in two short rushes without
losing a man, and reinforced their men who
were advancing through the beetroot fields on
our right.</p>

<p>Great numbers of troops now began to appear
on the ridge between Bethancourt and the little
wood. They advanced in three or four lines of
sections of ten to fifteen men extended to two
paces. Their line of advance was direct on the
village of Audencourt and on the low plateau on
our right, so that we were able to pour upon them
an enfilade fire. They were advancing in short
rushes across pasture-land which provided no cover
whatever, and they offered a clearly visible target
even when lying down. Although our men were
nearly all first-class shots, they did not often hit
the target. This was owing to the unpleasant fact
that the German gunners kept up a steady stream
of shrapnel, which burst just in front of our
trenches and broke over the top like a wave.
Shooting at the advancing enemy had to be timed
by the bursting shell.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_063" title="63"> </a>
We adopted the plan of firing two rounds and
then ducking down at intervals, which were determined
as far as could be arranged for by the arrival
of the shell. But the shooting of the battalion was
good enough to delay the enemy's advance. From
the 900-yard mark they took more than an hour to
reach their first objective, which was the Route
Nationale, 400 yards from our nearest trench.
Here they were able to concentrate in great numbers,
as the road runs along an embankment behind
which nothing but artillery could reach them. This
was the situation on our front at about three o'clock
in the afternoon. I happened to look down the line
and saw Captain Lumsden looking rather anxiously
to the rear. I then saw that a number of our
people were retiring. There was not much time
to think about what this might mean as the enemy
were beginning to cross the road; we had fixed
bayonets, and I thought we would have little
chance against the large number of Germans who
had concentrated behind the embankment. For a
long time, for nearly an hour, the British guns had
been silent, but they had not all retired. With a
white star-shaped flash two shells burst right over
the road behind which the Germans were massed.
Those two shells must have knocked out forty or
fifty men. The enemy fled right back up the hill
up to the 900-yard mark, followed by rapid fire
and loud cheering from all along the line.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_064" title="64"> </a>
The Germans were now re-forming on the hillside,
and a machine-gun hidden in the village of
Bethancourt began to play up and down our
trench.</p>

<p>The bullets began to spray too close to my left
ear, and laying my glasses on the parapet I was
about to sit down for a few minutes' rest, and
indeed had got half-way to the sitting position,
when the machine-gun found its target.</p>

<p>Recollections of what passed through my mind
at that moment is very clear. I knew instantly
what had happened. The blow might have come
from a sledge-hammer, except that it seemed to
carry with it an impression of speed. I saw for
one instant in my mind's eye the battlefield at
which I had been gazing through my glasses the
whole day. Then the vision was hidden by a
scarlet circle, and a voice said, "Mr&nbsp;H. has got
it." Through the red mist of the scarlet circle I
looked at my watch (the movement to do so had
begun in my mind before I was hit); it was spattered
with blood; the hands showed five minutes to
four. The voice which had spoken before said,
"Mr&nbsp;H. is killed."</p>

<p>Before losing consciousness, and almost at the
same time as the bullet struck, the questioning
thought was present in my mind as vividly as if
spoken, "Is this the end?" and present also was
the answer, "Not yet."</p>


<h3><a class="pagenum" name="page_065" title="65"> </a>
II.</h3>

<p>My knowledge of subsequent events is based
partly on information obtained from Private, now
Sergeant, R.&nbsp;Sinclair, who was next me in the
trench, and at once bandaged up my head with his
emergency field-dressing. It was still day when I
came back to life. My first consciousness was of
intolerable cramp in the legs. When Sinclair saw
that I was breathing, he laid me down on the
straw at the bottom of the trench and tried to give
me a drink out of my water-bottle. I was unable
to move any part of my body except the left hand,
with which I patted the right-hand pocket of my
coat, where I had carried, since leaving Plymouth,
a flask of old brandy. Red Cross books say that
brandy is the worst thing to give for head wounds;
but Sinclair poured the whole contents down my
throat, and I believe the stimulant saved my life.
I have been told that while I was unconscious
Captain Lumsden came down the line to see what
could be done for me. After drinking the contents
of my flask, I remember sending him up a message
to say I was feeling much better; and the answer
came back, "Captain Lumsden says he is very glad
indeed you are feeling better." Sinclair dug in
under the parapet and made the trench more comfortable
for me to lie in; shells were bursting overhead,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_066" title="66"> </a>
and several times I was conscious that he
was covering my face with his hand to protect me
from the flying shrapnel. During the rest of the
afternoon I had alternate periods of consciousness.
I sent up another message asking how things were
going, and the answer came back, "Captain Lumsden
is killed."</p>

<p>When I next regained consciousness Sinclair
told me that the enemy had again reached the
Route Nationale. "But don't you worry, sir," he
said, "we'll stick it all right; they won't come any
farther."</p>

<p>Just after midnight the order came to retire.</p>

<p>Sinclair and the other occupants of the trench
lifted me out, this operation coinciding with a
fusillade from the enemy, who from their position
on the road were firing volleys into the night&mdash;a
great waste of ammunition. Still, the bullets must
have been close overhead, for the men put me back
into the trench, jumped in after me, and waited till
all was quiet.</p>

<p>The second attempt to get me out was more
successful. I was laid on to a greatcoat and lifted
up by six men. It is probably not easy to carry
along such a burden in the dark, and they made a
very bad job of it. Some one suggested that a
substitute for a stretcher could be made with three
rifles, and the suggestion was at once adopted with
<a class="pagenum" name="page_067" title="67"> </a>
most painful results. I still remember the agony
caused by the weight of my body pressing down on
my neck and the small of the back, while my head,
just clearing the ground, trailed among the wet
beetroot leaves. The distance to the little wood
was not great, but to me the journey seemed to
take hours.</p>

<p>As the men struggled along with their awkward
burden, shadowy forms of the retiring company
passed close by in the pitch darkness of the
night. "Lend a hand here, some of you chaps,"
said Sinclair; "here's a wounded officer. Come
on, Ginger." Ginger, a big stout fellow, volunteered
to carry me on his back, and asked me
if I could hold on. He got me on to his
back, and I held on with my left arm round
his neck; but we did not go for more than a
hundred yards or so&mdash;the dead-weight was too
much for his strength&mdash;when the party came to
a halt.</p>

<p>During the whole of that night I was only intermittently
conscious of what was going on around
me. The only men I remember speaking to
after I had been laid down are the Regimental
Sergeant-Major and Lieutenant Houldsworth.
The Regimental Sergeant-Major laid his mackintosh
on the ground for me to lie on. To
Houldsworth I said what a fine thing it was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_068" title="68"> </a>
the men carrying me out of the trench; and he
replied, "It is nothing at all, but very natural,"
or words to that effect.</p>

<p>My one fear at this time was to be left behind
and taken prisoner, and the one hope, a very forlorn
one, was that the battalion stretcher-bearers
would be able to carry me away. But I heard
some one in the dark say that there were no
stretchers, and that orders had come to retire and
leave all wounded.</p>

<p>There was shuffling about of men and whispered
orders, then the not very distant tramp of marching
along the road, a sound which grew fainter and
fainter, till all in the night was silent: the battalion
had gone.</p>

<p>After an indeterminate time&mdash;perhaps half an
hour, perhaps an hour&mdash;I opened my eyes. I
was not alone. Two kilted forms, indistinct and
vaguely familiar, were seated on the ground close
beside my head.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I said, "and what are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"Macartney and Sinclair," replied the voice.</p>

<p>Macartney was the soldier who had acted as
servant for me since leaving Plymouth, but the
name of Sinclair was not familiar. "Who is
Sinclair?" I asked; and I remember the words of
his reply: "The soldier, sir, who looked after you
in the trench."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_069" title="69"> </a>
Each effort of speech and thought resulted in a
short period of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>When I next recovered there was the sound on
the road of marching men. Sinclair went off to
find out who they were, and ask (vain and foolish
hope it now seems) if they had stretchers or an
ambulance!</p>

<p>He came back to say that two companies of the
Royal Scots were marching down the road; they
had no stretcher-bearers; the Major in command
of the party, when he heard that Sinclair and
Macartney remained behind, ordered them to
rejoin their battalion. This the two soldiers at
first refused to do, and only left on receiving a
direct order from me. Sinclair went off first.
Macartney stopped behind a moment to speak.
"Have you any last message to send back to your
family?" was what he said. But to this question
I distinctly remember answering "No"; and
also saying, or perhaps only thinking, that I would
be my own messenger home to Scotland.</p>

<p>Macartney also disappeared into the night, and
this time I was really alone.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>What had happened in the meantime to the
battalion which had marched off in the dark while
I lay at the corner of that little wood does not
<a class="pagenum" name="page_070" title="70"> </a>
belong to the story, but the adventures of the
soldier who sat so long in the night by my side
have an indirect bearing on my own history.</p>

<p>The following letter was written by Sinclair at
Caudry, and posted on his escape from enemy
territory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letter">
<p class="right margrightsmall small smcaps">Caudry, Nord, France.</p>

<p><span class="smcaps">Dear &mdash;&mdash;</span>,&mdash;This last week has been the worst
week I ever put in in my life. Since Sunday
morning, 23.8.11, we have been fighting nearly
every day, and to make it worse, we are being
driven back by overwhelming numbers, but hope
to get support soon. As I am in a house in this
town, and can't move from the garret lest I be
seen, as the house is now in the hands of the
Germans, but, thank God, the people I am with
are our friends, I know I will be safe till some
arrangement is made about getting away. I am
not the only one that is here; there are some poor
fellows who have been in a cellar here since our
retreat from this place. I know you will be wondering
why I am left at the town, so I will try
and explain. The officer who was in the trench
with another four men and me was shot through
the head early in the engagement, but after a while
he came to his senses, but found he had lost the
power in his legs and right arm. Well, as it happened
that I was next him, it fell to me to make
<a class="pagenum" name="page_071" title="71"> </a>
him as comfortable as possible, as it was impossible
to get him shifted before dark.</p>

<p>We held the trenches till about 12&nbsp;<span class="small">P.M.</span>, when
we got the order to retire. When the officer heard
that we were to retire he seemed very much cut
up about it, as it meant that he would be left
behind to be taken prisoner.</p>

<p>We did not care to leave him, so four of us put
him on a coat and carried him about ¼ mile to
where the regiment was to meet; when we got
there we found there were no stretchers to put him
on, so another officer gave us an order to leave
him, and then decided to leave two men with him.
Well, as we were left to do our best for him, by
this time the battalion had passed, and not a
stretcher was to be found.</p>

<p>Hearing another regiment passing, I sent the
other man to try and get a stretcher or a horse;
but when he asked for a stretcher, the officer of
the other regiment asked what it was for, then told
him he was to go back at once and leave a water-bottle
and take any message, and that both of us
were to fall in in rear of his battalion at once.
When our officer heard of this he told us to obey
orders, so what could we do? We made him as
comfortable as possible, then went to rejoin the
battalion, but found that we had missed the road
they had taken, so we were lost.</p>

<p>We decided to sit in a field till daylight came,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_072" title="72"> </a>
and with it came an officer of the Royal Irish, and
four men who were in the same boat as ourselves.
So we joined with them to try and find our way,
but we did not get more than three miles when
we ran into the enemy,&mdash;then it was every man
for himself. I heard after from the village people
that five of them were made prisoners. Anyhow
I have not seen any of them since.</p>

<p>Well, when I got away I hid at the back of a
garden; they made search for me, but I happened
to escape from their view. I had to sit in the
same spot for over seven hours till all the Germans
were clear of the place, and they were a mighty
lot to pass. However, after a time the man who
owned the garden got his eye on me; he then
started to work about his garden. When he came
up my length he dropped a loaf from under his
jacket; it was very acceptable, as I was feeling
very hungry. I thought it was about time I was
moving, but did not know which way to go. I
then decided that I would go back and see how
my officer had got on, but did not get far when
I struck into another lot of the enemy, and had
to sit tight for another two hours. After that I
got the place where our officer was left, but found
that he was away from that place. I have since
heard that he is in hospital at this place&mdash;Caudry.
I then thought it would be advisable to make for
Maubeuge, as I knew that there was a large fort
<a class="pagenum" name="page_073" title="73"> </a>
there; but when I made inquiries from the people
as to the direction, all they would tell me was
that the enemy was all round, and it would be
impossible to get away from here.</p>

<p>In fact, I had been very lucky to get as far as
I did without being caught, so they advised me
to hide my kit and rifle, and put on civilian
clothes till such time as the road gets cleared
of the enemy. After having changed my clothes,
one of them brought me to this town, and left
me at this house....</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I am trying to escape from this place
to-night.</p>

<p>The night passed slowly by the little wood
among the beetroot, where I had been left with
my rolled-up mackintosh for a pillow, and a
shell-torn greatcoat for shelter from the drizzling
rain. On my left the burning village of Audencourt,
less than half a mile away, lit up the night
with a steady glow which occasionally leapt into
flame. On the right, some distance away, a house,
or houses, flamed high for a long time, and then
all was black and dark again. The slowly moving
dawn showed that I was lying within ten or twelve
<a class="pagenum" name="page_074" title="74"> </a>
yards off the road which runs from Beaumont
across the fields to the road between Caudry
and Audencourt.</p>

<p>As I looked towards Audencourt a man in khaki
came running. At the sound of my whistle he
leapt aside like a deer, then when he saw me lying,
ran up. I asked to be lifted down into the sunken
road, as I was afraid of lying out in the open on
account of possible shell fire. The soldier (a man
in the Irish Rifles) took me by the shoulders and
dragged me down the bank, made me as comfortable
as he could, and then ran off down the road,
crossed the road between Caudry and Audencourt,
and disappeared across country. Hardly had he
disappeared from view when two shells exploded
somewhere behind me.</p>

<p>It was now clear, but not full daylight. Two
French peasants came up the road; I tried to
call to them with the purpose of getting carried
away on a cart, and so avoid being taken prisoner.
But the peasants were frightened to come near
me; they made a detour in the field, and joined
the road again fifty yards higher up.</p>

<p>The first I saw of the Germans was a small
party of about seven or eight advancing across
the field on my left in extended order. The one
nearest to hand saw me, and calling the others,
they all came and stood on the road in a
circle. Their attitude was distinctly sympathetic,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_075" title="75"> </a>
but I was too far gone to struggle with their
language.</p>

<p>I watched these men following the line taken
by the Irish soldier, and wondered if they were
tracking him, and would overtake him.</p>

<p>Before very long another and larger party appeared
beside me on the road, but I was quite
unable to speak to them, and after stopping to
stare, they went on their way.</p>

<p>The whole tide of invasion was now sweeping
over the land. Several Uhlans galloped past
across the fields, and the road from Audencourt,
which was about 150 yards from where I lay,
was filled with a procession of machine-guns
and transport waggons.</p>

<p>For some inexplicable reason I now tried to
get away. By seizing a tuft of grass in the
left hand I could move along a few inches at
a time. After advancing in this manner about
a foot along the edge of the road, I collapsed
from exhaustion, and drew the greatcoat over
my head. I do not know how long I had been
thus covered up when I heard a shout, and peeping
through one of the holes in the coat saw a
German soldier standing on top of the bank. He
was gesticulating and pointing to his revolver,
trying to find out if I was armed! but he soon
saw I was past further fighting.</p>

<p>He offered me a drink from his water-bottle, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_076" title="76"> </a>
pointed to the Red Cross on his arm. I can never
hope to convey to any one what a relief it was to
me to see the cross even on the arm of an enemy.
The man asked me if I could walk, tried to lift
me up, and when he saw I was paralysed said he
would go for a stretcher.</p>

<p>"You will go away and leave me here," I said.</p>

<p>"I am of the Red Cross," he replied; "you are
therefore my Kamarad and I will never leave you."</p>

<p>I gave him my whistle. Before going off to seek
for help he stood on top of the bank looking
down on me where I lay, and pointed once more
to the Red Cross badge. "Kamarad, Kamarad, I
will come back; never fear, I will come back."</p>

<p>I covered up my head again and fell into a semi-conscious
stupor.</p>

<p>The sound of a step on the road aroused my
attention, and for a brief instant my eyes seemed
to deceive, for they showed me the tall figure of an
old man dressed in a white overall. Behind him
were two youths carrying a stretcher.</p>

<p>The figure spoke in French: "Are you a wounded
British officer? There are three that I am looking
for; do you know where the others are?"</p>

<p>I told him our trenches were close behind; and
as he and his acolytes were off at once for further
search, leaving the stretcher on the road, I added,
"First put me on the stretcher." To lie on the
stretcher after the hard ground was inexpressible
<a class="pagenum" name="page_077" title="77"> </a>
relief to my paralysed limbs. Soon the white
figure returned. "We have found them, but they
are both dead, <i>et un d'eux a l'air si jeune</i>." The sun
was shining with vigorous warmth. One of the
boys shaded my head with his cap, and we were
about to start when my friend of the German Red
Cross appeared on top of the bank with a stretcher.
At the same time our little group was joined by a
young Uhlan officer. The German Red Cross
man wished to transfer me to his stretcher, and
the old man in white was determined not to let me
go. The beginning of a discussion instantly ceased
on the arrival of the German officer, who, speaking
French with ease, turned first to the old Frenchman,
"Where is your Red Cross armlet? What
authority have you to search for wounded?"</p>

<p>The old man drew from his pocket a Red Cross
badge, which seemed sufficient authority. The
officer, sitting on his horse between the two
stretchers, then looked down at me, "Choisissez,"
he said.</p>

<p>I answered him with a smile, "J'y suis j'y reste."</p>

<p>The German Red Cross soldier came up to my
stretcher and took my hand, "Adieu, Kamarad."</p>

<p>The young German officer leant over and offered
me a piece of chocolate. "Why have you English
come against us?" he said; "it is no use. We
shall be in Paris in three days. We have no
quarrel with you English."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_078" title="78"> </a>
His eyes sparkled with the joy of victory, yet as
he rode off I knew that some day his turn would
come to lie even as I was.</p>

<p>At the entrance, or near the entrance to the village
of Caudry, we were stopped by another officer
on horseback. This time the colloquy was in
English. "Officer? What regiment? Good!
What Brigade?" "I don't know." "How many
divisions were you?" "I don't know." "Ah, you
won't tell me, but I know there were four divisions.
We have captured men from many different
regiments. Pass on."</p>

<p>On the way through the village the stretcher
party was held up by the passing of a grey-coated
infantry regiment. I have in my mind just a
glimpse of the houses in the village, and one of
them wrecked by a shell, but I was too exhausted
to keep my eyes open when my stretcher was put
down outside the school, which had been turned
into a field-ambulance during yesterday's battle.</p>

<p>The French have many qualities, but order in
emergency is not one of them.</p>

<p>A crowd of civilians blocked the entrance to
the school, and swarmed chattering around my
stretcher: "Il est mort! Mais non il n'est pas
mort, il respire! Mais je dis qu'il est mort!"</p>

<p>I settled the discussion by opening one weakly
indignant eye.</p>

<p>On being carried into a room which is on the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_079" title="79"> </a>
right as you go in at the lobby, I was put on a
table. Part of the crowd from the street followed
on behind. Some one at once took my boots off,
and forgot to give them back again. The doctor
took off my bandage and applied something which
felt like snow to the top of my head, then whispered
in my ear, "Do not speak, do not think;
keep quiet if you wish to live."</p>

<p>The furniture had been removed from la maison
Camille Wanecq and the shop turned into a
hospital ward. The tall grey-bearded man in the
white coat, who had taken complete charge,
brought me to this house, which was opposite his
own. Here on the night of the 26th word had
been left that three British officers were lying
wounded near the village of Audencourt. At daybreak
M.&nbsp;Heloire had put on his white overall (he
is a veterinary surgeon), set out with a stretcher,
and searched until he found me lying by the roadside.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_080" title="80"> </a>
Still under the guidance of M.&nbsp;Heloire, I was
taken through the shop up to a room on the first
floor. The staircase is very steep, and they had
great difficulty with the stretcher. I distinctly
remember wondering if a coffin would present
equal difficulties on the way down.</p>

<p>For the first time I began to feel great pain in
my feet. There was also an awful twitching,
jerky, sawing movement of the right arm, over
which I had no control. This spasmodic movement
was only stilled by the injection of morphia.</p>

<p>When the effects of the first injection began to
pass off, I was conscious of some one sitting by
the bedside, and, feeling very thirsty, I asked the
shadowy form "à boire." The shadow did not
respond, and after a while made the following
remark: "I dunno what 'e is saying; 'e must be
off his chump."</p>

<p>My brain was scarcely able for thought in more
than one language, and it was after a long pause
that I said in English, "Who the devil are
you?"</p>

<p>The voices said they were English Red Cross
soldiers, and had been sent in to look after me by
a tall old gentleman dressed in a white coat.</p>

<p>Now this most excellent M.&nbsp;Heloire had acted as
he thought for the best, but the result was not at
all a happy one for me. Whenever I wanted anything
the soldiers went downstairs and brought up
<a class="pagenum" name="page_081" title="81"> </a>
somebody to whom I had to interpret my requirements.
In my exhausted condition this was impossible.
The request for a drink and the short
conversation with the soldiers had nearly finished
me off, but I made one more effort to a large
French-speaking shadow. I said, "Renvoyez les
anglais."</p>

<p>And so the English soldiers were sent away, and
I came under the care of Marthe and Madeleine.</p>

<p>To my dim consciousness all persons were manifest
as shadows. Marthe and Madeleine took turns
watching me day and night. Marthe sat weeping;
a long, long way off her shadow seemed, yet in an
instant that same shadow was bending over the
bed. "A boire." The water remained untasted;
some of it trickled down my face. Then they tried
in vain to get me to suck the liquid up a straw. I
could hear every word spoken in whispers round
my bed. "Il faut aller chercher M.&nbsp;le Curé et M.&nbsp;Heloire,"
and some one at the door murmured in a
low voice, "Il va mourir cette nuit le pauvre."
My own thoughts were monopolised by the thirst
of fever. Deep black shadows now hovered round
my bed. There seemed to be two&mdash;one larger and
more active than the other. A voice full of pity
asked me if I wished to make my confession. The
possibility of speech was far away, and even to
think was an effort that seemed dangerous. Seeing
that I was too weak to make any response, the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_082" title="82"> </a>
two Curés administered Extreme Unction. The
sound of prayers, which seemed so far away,
mingled with the tramp of soldiers, martial music,
the rattle of wheels on the cobble-stones, the ceaseless
tumult of invasion which for two days and
two nights rolled on through the paved streets of
Caudry.</p>

<p>It was indeed a feeble dam which from the 23rd
to the 26th had held back such a torrent as, while
I lay there listening, was flowing on triumphant
and irresistible.</p>

<p>Early next morning M.&nbsp;le Curé returned.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marthe, "he is better; see, he can
drink from a glass." Marthe and Madeleine were
arranging a table, some one in the room was weeping,
the shadows moved and prayed.</p>

<p>There is between life and death a period when
the normal process of thought comes to an end&mdash;a
new mode of consciousness is taking the place of
the old&mdash;the soul, standing on the threshold, looks
back at the body lying helpless.</p>

<p>During the night, in that little room in Caudry,
while Marthe sat by my bedside and wept, I was
slowly discovering another self, distinct from the
body lying on the bed, and yet connected with
it in mist and shadow; and this was the shadow
of death.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_083" title="83"> </a>
CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="small">CAMBRAI.</span></h2>


<p>"En haut! Montez au numéro sept," shouted a
shrill female voice; "c'est un officier, il faut le
mettre au numéro sept."</p>

<p>And so I became No.&nbsp;7, Hôpital Civil, Cambrai.
My room was a small one on the first floor; the
furniture consisted of two beds and two iron
stands. The floor was polished, the walls painted
a dull brown, the door of iron, with upper panel
of glazed glass. It was some time before these
surroundings presented themselves to my view.
At least forty-eight hours I remained without
much consciousness, thankful in my lucid intervals
that the jolting of the cart which brought me the
eight miles from Caudry had ceased, thankful for
the soft bed and the quiet cool room.</p>

<p>I wonder if Dr Debu remembers his first visit
to me as well as I do? My memory of all that
happened during these days is very clear.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_084" title="84"> </a>
I could not yet see faces, to me nurse and doctor
were different coloured shadows, yet I remember
well the nurse whispering to the doctor, "He is
very bad," and the doctor answering, "Oui! mais
je crois qu'il va s'en tirer." I do not remember
exactly when I began to recognise faces and to
speak. They told me later, but at the time I did
not realise that the words came singly and with
great difficulty, as if the language was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>My powers of speech were stimulated by a visit
from Madame la Directrice of the hospital, who
came to my bedside speaking with weird gestures
in a strange tongue. It occurred to me that she
might perhaps be trying to speak English, and
so I addressed her slowly as follows: "Mettez
vous bien dans la tête, Madame, que je parle le
Français aussi bien que vous." After that day no
one in the hospital made any further attempt to
practise English at my bedside.</p>

<p>The adjoining bed was occupied for a short time
by a French Colonel, who had been shot through
both thighs and seemed in great pain. The whole
night long he kept up a constant groaning, with
intermittent exclamation in a loud voice, "Je suis
dans des souffrances atrrroces." These Marseillais
are a most talkative race. This one was also very
deaf.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p084i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">
  Le Colonel Faméchon.</p>
</div>

<p>Attempts at conversation with me were hopeless,
as he could not hear my whisper. However, he
<a class="pagenum" name="page_085" title="85"> </a>
found consolation by talking to himself about himself
most of the night.</p>

<p>When the nurse came in next morning she paid
no attention to the old Colonel, whose wounds,
although severe, were not dangerous, but after
taking my temperature she looked anxiously at
the thermometer.</p>

<p>My temperature was up two points!</p>

<p>That morning the Colonel was removed to
another part of the hospital.</p>

<p>As the window of my room could not be opened,
I was taken into an exactly similar room on the
opposite side of the corridor. This was a pleasanter
room than the other, it got the morning sun,
and the window opened on to the kitchen garden.
Shortly after moving into this room two visitors
came to see me. One was M.&nbsp;le Médecin Chef,
who was afterwards imprisoned at the Hôpital 106.
At this time, however, he was allowed by the
Germans to visit the hospitals. I was quite unable
to speak the day he came to see me, but was able
to recognise and wonder at the French uniform.</p>

<p>My other visitor was a German officer. I can
only vaguely remember that he was tall, well-built,
and I think wore a beard. He spoke English
fluently, and said that he used often to visit Cairo
many years ago, when one of the battalions of my
regiment was stationed there. I asked him if he
would send news of me to England. He sat down
<a class="pagenum" name="page_086" title="86"> </a>
by my bed, and put my name and regiment down
in his note-book.</p>

<p>The post-card he sent, which reached the War
Office <i>viâ</i> Geneva, was signed von Schwerin. It
may seem a small thing to be grateful for, but the
sending of that post-card was a very hard favour to
obtain and a very great favour to be granted.</p>

<p>During the first few months of the German
occupation of Cambrai no messages or letters
were allowed to leave the district, and the severest
penalties were imposed on those who were caught
attempting to get letters out of the country. It
was said that two German officers were sent home
in disgrace for writing to Geneva on behalf of a
wounded prisoner.</p>

<p>On September 15 a French Red Cross nurse
came in to see me at 10 o'clock in the evening.
She was a tall, fine-looking woman, dressed in a
large heavy coat. After asking my name, she said
she had a letter to give me from an officer of my
regiment.</p>

<p>The letter, written in pencil, on a page from an
exercise book, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="right small smcaps margrightsmall">Caudry Hospital.</p>

<p><span class="smcaps">My dear M.</span>,&mdash;So glad to hear you are going on
all right, as I heard you had a bad wound in the
head, which sounded serious. I saw a priest a few
days ago who told me there was an officer of my
<a class="pagenum" name="page_087" title="87"> </a>
regiment at Cambrai, and I presumed it must be
you.</p>

<p>I also heard you were brought to the hospital the
day I was brought in, but had left by the time I
got here.</p>

<p>I hear our regiment was captured <i>en bloc</i> at
Bertry; they marched slap into the Germans in
the dark, so we may be better off where we are.
I hear M., M., and L. were killed the day we
got wounded.</p>

<p>We are very well done here; it is rather an
amateur show, but every one does what they can
for us. I got a bullet across my scalp, but it is
nearly healed now, and I am up and about. I
expect &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Btt. must be in the country by now
somewhere, but I don't know.</p>

<p>I hope this finds you in good spirits. I think
we may hope to be relieved soon.</p>

<p>Best luck.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="right margrightsmall">A. A. D.</p>

<p>A nurse from Cambrai is here who has kindly
volunteered to take this back with her.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<p>The nurse told me that she was returning to
Caudry next day and would take back an answer.
She also added that my friend hoped to escape.</p>

<p>Next morning I was able to scrawl two or three
lines, holding a pencil in the right hand and
pushing it along with the left.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_088" title="88"> </a>
Major D. succeeded in getting away from
Caudry, and after many adventures crossed safely
over the Dutch frontier.</p>

<p>During the first month of my stay in the hospital,
with a French surgeon, French nurses, and French
soldier orderlies, there was little to remind me
of the fact that I was a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>No one in the hospital believed that the Germans
would remain at Cambrai for more than a few
weeks. The arrival of the French troops was
expected and hoped for from day to day. Optimists
declared that in a week the city would be
delivered, and only the most pessimistic put off
the joyful day to the end of September. The prevailing
belief that the Germans would soon be
driven out of the country was strengthened by
the vague reports of disaster to the German
arms which were current in Cambrai after the
battle of the Marne.</p>

<p>At this time every story, however improbable,
found ardent believers. French and British troops
were seen hovering on the outskirts if not at the
very gates of the city. It was even asserted that
somebody had seen Japanese troops! 200,000 of
whom had landed at Marseilles some few days
before! The suppression of all newspapers left
the universal craving for news unsatisfied, and
the daily paper was replaced by short type-written
notes which were secretly passed from hand to
<a class="pagenum" name="page_089" title="89"> </a>
hand. I remember the contents of one of these
compositions which was handed me by a visitor
with great parade of secrecy and importance.</p>

<p>It was composed of brief short sentences:
"Cambrai the last town in German occupation.
Germans retiring all along the line. Maubeuge
re-occupied by French and British troops. Revolution
in Berlin. Streets in flames. Death
of Empress."</p>

<p>All such absurd stories probably emanated from
a German source and represent some obscure form
of German humour.</p>

<p>The most exciting incident which took place at
Cambrai in September was the visit of two aeroplanes,
either French or English, which flew over
the town just out of rifle range.</p>

<p>The aviators were greeted with a tremendous
fusillade, which was started by the sentry on the
church tower close to my window. For nearly
ten minutes rifles, machine-guns, and artillery
kept up a steady fire. The nurses who had rushed
out to see the aeroplanes soon came running back,
as bullets were falling on the hospital roof.</p>

<p>The sequel of this first air raid was long a
subject of discussion. The Germans allege that
bombs were dropped by the aviators. The French
declare that German guns fired at them from outside
the town, and that the shells fell and exploded
in the town.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_090" title="90"> </a>
The casualties were 7 civilians and 15 Germans
killed, and a number of wounded. Seven horses
were killed on the Place du Marché.</p>

<p>When the firing ceased a poor woman and her
little child of three years old were brought into
the hospital very severely wounded. The mother's
leg had to be amputated, and the poor little baby
had one of its arms taken off.</p>

<p>Although the German authorities blamed the
British, it is hardly likely that bombs were dropped
on Cambrai in September 1914, and there can
be little doubt that the damage was caused by
German shells.</p>

<p>During the first two or three weeks of my stay
at the hospital I saw very little of either the
surgeon or the two nurses, with whom afterwards
I came to be on terms of great friendship. At
that time the number of wounded was so great
that the nurses had not a single minute to spare.</p>

<p>The hospital was overflowing with the wounded
soldiers; many died within a few hours of arriving,
and many more died in the operating-room. The
number of severe cases was so great that it was
impossible that all should receive the needful
attention in time. Dr Debu spent twenty-four
hours at a stretch in the operating-room.</p>

<p>More and more wounded kept arriving, until
every bed was occupied and wounded men were
lying in the corridors, and many were turned away
from the door because there was no room.</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_091" title="91"> </a>
From the 27th of August to the first days of
September, the increasing number of deaths in
the hospital made it more and more difficult to
make arrangements for removing the bodies to
the cemetery. It was therefore suggested that
graves should be dug in the hospital garden
opposite my window.</p>

<p>The graves were actually dug, but were too
shallow and could not be used. The open
trenches remained empty for some weeks, until
some of the wounded soldiers took on the job
of filling in the earth.</p>

<p>Two nurses had charge of the ward and rooms
on our floor&mdash;Mlle. Waxin, one of the hospital
permanent staff, and Mlle. Debu, the surgeon's
daughter.</p>

<p>Mlle. Waxin had also charge of the operating-room;
she was as clever as a surgeon and as strict
as a gendarme with her patients. Rather under the
average height, her figure inclined, but very slightly,
to plumpness. Very dark eyes that could sparkle
and also look severe. A young, round, rosy,
but very determined face. A typical French
girl.</p>

<p>Mlle. Debu, although without hospital training
and with no previous experience of nursing, volunteered
from the first day of the invasion to help in
her father's hospital. Mlle. Debu showed the true
spirit of France. She was only nineteen. Never
for a moment did she lose courage. From the very
<a class="pagenum" name="page_092" title="92"> </a>
start she worked with the skill and endurance of
a trained nurse, and her face, ever quick to smile,
never betrayed, even for a moment, the fatigues
and worries of the day.</p>

<p>When the rays of the morning sun lit up the
top of the glass door it was time for breakfast,
and punctually to the minute Mlle. Debu appeared
with a cup of chocolate which she made for me
herself. "Bonjour, Monsieur le numéro sept," the
brown eyes twinkled and the dimple smiled at the
daily jest.</p>

<p>The days passed very slowly. I was too weak
to read, and even the occasional visit from a
wounded French or British soldier was more than
my head could bear. Every afternoon, at about
five o'clock, a body of German infantry marched
past the hospital, singing the Wacht am Rhein
in part-song, an unpleasant daily reminder of the
conqueror's presence.</p>

<p>In the room opposite there was a German officer
who spent most of the day walking up and down
the corridor whistling a hackneyed and out-of-date
waltz tune. He always whistled the same tune,
and it got on my nerves. The nurse told me that
there was nothing the matter with him except an
alleged pimple on his foot. This officer must have
been a delicate specimen of German militarism.
He was known in the hospital as "Parapluie,"
owing to the fact that when setting out one evening
<a class="pagenum" name="page_093" title="93"> </a>
to dine in town he borrowed an umbrella to protect
his uniform from the rain.</p>

<p>A regular plague of flies was one of the minor
discomforts which had to be endured during the day.
Mlle. Debu stuck a piece of fly-paper to the gas
chandelier which hung in the middle of the room,
but only a few dozen flies fell victims to greed and
curiosity, and the others seemed to take warning
from the sad example. At meal-times there were
always crowds of these uninvited guests, who, from
the contempt with which they treated me, were
evidently quite aware that I was unable to drive
them away. One fly, rather bigger than the others
(Alphonse I called him), was very persistent in his
endeavours to land on my nose. When tired of
this game he would leave me for a while and circle
round and round the fly-paper, always about to
land, and yet always suspicious of danger. The
career of Alphonse was cut short by a method
of attack which is probably considered by the
insect kingdom as contrary to the rules of civilised
warfare. One afternoon Madame la Directrice
brought up a box of powder which she said was
guaranteed to destroy all the flies in the room in
half an hour. The windows were shut, and the
powder was sprinkled all over the room and all
over my bed. In about ten minutes it was impossible
to breathe. The powder got into my eyes
and lungs, and I had to ring and ask for the windows
<a class="pagenum" name="page_094" title="94"> </a>
to be opened. But the flies had succumbed,
and poor Alphonse was swept up off the floor next
morning along with at least a hundred of his companions.</p>

<p>I gathered a great deal of information about
what was going on in the hospital from watching
the glazed window in the door.</p>

<p>One morning I said to Mlle. Debu when she
brought in breakfast, "Who was it died in the
ward last night?"</p>

<p>The nurses always tried to hide from me the
large number of deaths that took place in the early
days, but I knew all about it from studying the
glazed window through which the outlines of
passers-by could faintly be distinguished. One
man followed at a short distance by another meant
a stretcher was being carried past. It is not hard
to guess what is the burden of stretchers which
are carried out of the ward when the dawn is
just breaking. At this hour the hospital is at its
quietest. But in the garden the sparrows twitter
and chirrup that it will soon be time to get up.
An early and hungry blackbird will sometimes
whistle one or two impatient notes to hasten the
coming of day. When the new daylight enters my
room with its fresh, clean morning air, the first
picture shown on the glass door is that of two men
marching, with an interval between. They wear
slippers and make no noise. And many months
<a class="pagenum" name="page_095" title="95"> </a>
after the name of the burden they carry on the
stretcher will appear on the Roll of Honour&mdash;"Previously
reported missing&mdash;now reported died
of wounds as a prisoner of war."</p>

<p>It is usually about eight o'clock that the surgeon's
visit takes place. First there is the rattle
and jingle of bottles all along the corridor, which
heralds the advance of the portable dressing-table.
This table runs on rubber wheels, and is fitted with
an ingenious basin in which the surgeon can wash
his hands under a tap which is turned on by pressing
a lever with the foot. Sometimes, when the
door of my room has been left ajar, I can see as
they pass the surgeons in their white overalls followed
by the nurses and orderlies. There are one
or two very serious cases which have to be dressed
by the surgeons, but the visit is chiefly an inspection.
Cases where the balance lies between
amputation and death have to be submitted to
the sure judgment of Dr Debu.</p>

<p>During the early days there was a long waiting
list for the operating-room, as there was scarcely
time even to deal with those who were in immediate
danger of death.</p>

<p>In the majority of the cases brought in the
wounds had not been dressed for several days.
Men had remained three or four days at the place
where they had been struck down. Others were
put into farmhouses with broken legs or arms,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_096" title="96"> </a>
and left unattended for a fortnight. Others
again&mdash;and they were very numerous&mdash;had been
brought into Cambrai by the Germans and deposited
in some temporary ambulance-shed, and
left with scarcely any medical attention, their
wounds dressed perhaps once a week. When
such poor sufferers as these arrived at last at
the hospital, it was as a rule too late for
anything but amputation, and often too late even
for that.</p>

<p>One evening, about the 10th of September, a
German officer arrived at the hospital with an
order that all wounded Germans should be at
once taken to the station. There was at this
time, in one of the rooms adjoining mine, a
German officer who had been shot in the bladder.
Mlle. Waxin had charge of the case, and, thanks
to her careful nursing, there seemed to be some
chance of his recovery. When the order came to
move all Germans, Mlle. Waxin protested that
if this officer were moved he would die. But the
Germans refused to listen to her, and took their
officer off to the station. That same evening the
poor fellow was taken back from the station, and
died in the hospital within an hour of his return.
Next day a large number of French and British
wounded were taken away to Germany.</p>

<p>The vacant beds were at once filled with cases
brought in for operation from the various temporary
<a class="pagenum" name="page_097" title="97"> </a>
hospitals. Among the new arrivals were
several British officers, two of whom, Irvine in
the King's Own and Halls in the Hampshire
Regiment, were put in the room opposite mine.
Halls had been shot through both ankles, but
after a few days managed to hobble across the
corridor to pay me a visit. A French officer,
wounded in the knee, used sometimes to come
and see me, but I have forgotten his name.</p>

<p>It was on a Sunday that the sad announcement
was made that my two newly-found friends were
to be taken away to Germany. Halls said it
was such bad luck to be carried away just as
the French were about to enter the town!</p>

<p>The French soldier-orderlies all left the hospital
at the same time as Halls and Irvine, and the
duty of looking after my room fell to an individual
named François. Cheerfulness was his only
virtue; laziness and dirt were his principal and
more obvious vices. François was a young fellow
of nineteen, formerly a bargee working on a
neighbouring canal. Owing to an accident which
happened about a year before war broke out, his
leg had to be taken off, and he was afterwards
kept on in the hospital to act as handyman. In
spite of his wooden leg he was wonderfully active,
and when aroused was capable of doing a lot of
work. François invariably wore a very large and
very dirty cap, tilted right on to the back of his
<a class="pagenum" name="page_098" title="98"> </a>
thick, black, curly hair. The cap and the fag-end
of a cigarette sticking to his under lip were permanent
fixtures. His breath smelt of garlic and
sour wine. The only person in the hospital to
whose orders he paid the least attention was
Mlle. Waxin, and it was only under her severe eye
that François made any use of broom or duster.</p>

<p>On fine afternoons during the last week of
September I was taken out on to the Terrace on
a stretcher. Irvine was also lifted out in a chair,
and looked very thin and pale. Like most of us
in the hospital, he had been wounded on the 26th
August; the wound was a very severe one, the
bullet having actually hit the edge of his identity
disc. Two other subalterns in the Manchester
Regiment were both lying out on stretchers, and
we had a talk with Captain Beresford of the
Worcesters, who was already so far recovered
from a bullet in the lung that he was able to
walk. Several wounded French and British
soldiers were also taken out to enjoy the sun.</p>

<p>One of the Frenchmen I at once recognised to
be a Curé. His figure was more suited to the
soutane than to the uniform of a Pioupiou, and
a very pronounced accent betrayed the fact that
he belonged to the Auvergne country. His comrades
were evidently in the way of teasing him
about his accent, and a great discussion was going
on (with much winking at me by the other
<a class="pagenum" name="page_099" title="99"> </a>
soldiers). In what part of France was the best
French spoken? M.&nbsp;le Curé addressed me as an
impartial witness: "N'est pas, mon capitaine,
nous autres dans le midi de la France nous
parlons plus grrammaticalemaing que les habitans
du Nord&mdash;nous avons un peu <i>d'assent</i> mais nous
parlons grrammaticalemaing." My verdict being
in M.&nbsp;le Curé's favour, he entered into animated
conversation, delighted, he said, to meet "<i>enfaing</i>"
some one who could explain to him a question in
which he was much interested but of which he
understood nothing: "Qu'est que ce que le
'homme-roulle'?" It was time to go in, so we
parted, and my inability to answer his question
remained undiscovered. I never saw the Curé
again, and was told he had been taken off to
Germany.</p>

<p>Among the lesser discomforts of the early days
in the Civil Hospital was the ordeal of being
washed, which I only went through twice in the
first three weeks. The nurses could not think of
washing patients, as they had not time to dress
all the wounds that required urgent attention, and
therefore the washing was done by François, and
it was a sort of job to which he was evidently
quite unaccustomed.</p>

<p>The impossibility of getting any sleep, the pain
from lying in one position, and the irritation of
repeated mustard plasters (which were brought up
<a class="pagenum" name="page_100" title="100"> </a>
and applied by François), soon became relatively
unimportant in the presence of a new trouble. One
evening something in my head began to throb. It
felt like the steady regular beat of a pulse deep
inside. When Mlle. Waxin came to see me that
night I told her about it. Of course, as all good
nurses do, she said it was nothing, but she would
speak to the surgeon. Next morning Dr Debu,
after examination, declared that an abscess had
formed in the wound owing to the presence of
a bone splinter. This would necessitate a small
operation.</p>

<p>My first acquaintance with the movable dressing-table,
which carried a fearsome collection of surgical
weapons, took place at nine o'clock that evening.
Mlle. Waxin started the proceedings with a shaving-brush.
After lathering the top of my head, she
then shaved the hair off all round the wound, and I
was ready for the surgeon's visit. When Dr Debu
came in, he said it would be better if I could
manage to do without an anæsthetic. "How long
are you going to be?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not more than a minute."</p>

<p>The apprehension was worse than the reality. A
quick movement of the lancet laid open the abscess
and disclosed the jagged splintered edge of the
skull. With a pair of pincers the surgeon broke off
one or two pieces of bone about the size of a tooth,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_101" title="101"> </a>
then jammed in a piece of lint soaked in iodine.
The whole affair lasted two minutes. From now
onwards my head had to be dressed every day, and
a piece of lint nearly a foot long was pushed in
every morning to keep the wound open, and any
splinters that could be found were snipped off with
the pincers.</p>

<p>Now that the pressure of work in the hospital
was somewhat relieved, my two nurses would
sometimes come and sit in my room, and I was
cheered with a regular afternoon visit from some of
the nurses from neighbouring hospitals. Mlle.
L'Etoile and her friends used to bring me books,
boxes of the sweets known as "Bétises de Cambrai,"
peaches, nectarines, grapes, and long, fat,
juicy "poires Duchesse," the largest and sweetest
pears I have ever tasted. Afternoon tea "avec
le numéro sept" was a cheerful and often noisy
meal. It was such a relief to forget for a moment
the presence of the Boche and to hear the sound of
laughter.</p>

<p>In addition to my friends who were regular
visitors, we had occasional visits from curious
but well-meaning strangers. Some people find
it impossible when visiting hospitals to get
beyond the everlasting phrase, "Where were you
wounded?"</p>

<p>The limit of conversational inanity was reached
<a class="pagenum" name="page_102" title="102"> </a>
by one of these casual visitors, a stout blonde dame.
Our conversation ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bonjour, bonjour; vous êtes un officier anglais,
n'est-ce pas?"</p>

<p>"Mais oui, Madame!"</p>

<p>"Où avez-vous été blessé?"</p>

<p>"A la tête...."</p>

<p>"Vous restez couché comme ça toute la journée?"</p>

<p>"C'est que j'ai la jambe paralysée."</p>

<p>"Et vous n'avez pas eu de blessure à la jambe?"</p>

<p>"Rien du tout."</p>

<p>"Alors vous étiez donc paralysé avant la
guerre!!!"</p>

<p>"Ce qui prouve," as one of my nurses said, "que
toutes les bétises de Cambrai ne sont pas dans les
boîtes à bonbons."</p>

<p>It was about this time that a visit was paid to
the hospital by Mgr. l'Archevêque de Cambrai,
who went round all the wards with kind words
of consolation for each one. The Archbishop
hesitated on the threshold of my room, and was
about to pass on, fearing no doubt to disturb me,
and perhaps foreseeing the probable difficulties of
conversation.</p>

<p>"Entrez donc, Monseigneur," I said; "Veuillez
prendre la peine de vous asseoir."</p>

<p>The Archbishop was quite taken aback, and I
could see Mlle. Waxin behind was convulsed with
inward mirth. She said to me afterwards,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_103" title="103"> </a>
"Où êtes vous allé chercher de si grandes
phrases?"</p>

<p>His lordship came and sat by my bedside for a
few moments. He is a man of great personality
and charm, who gives an impression of strength
and tact.</p>

<p>After the Archbishop had gone, Mlle. Waxin told
me that the vacant bed in my room was to be
occupied by a British officer. This turned out to
be Wilkinson in the Manchester Regiment. The
manner of his arrival next morning was somewhat
peculiar. The door opened slowly, and a large,
very tall man, dressed like a nigger minstrel in
black-and-white striped pyjamas, and covered
with bandages, hopped across the room on the
left leg; with three vigorous hops he was sitting
on the bed. His right foot was bandaged, also
one of his hands. Nothing could be seen of his
face but a nose and one eye.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness there is some one to talk to,"
was what the strange figure said. Then followed
the necessary mutual explanations.</p>

<p>The only method of movement possible to
Wilkinson was hopping, at which he had become
quite an expert. Shrapnel bullets had lodged
themselves all over his body, fortunately avoiding
vital spots. The worst of his wounds was a
fractured jaw, which gave him a great deal of
pain, and made chewing of food impossible.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_104" title="104"> </a>
When Mlle. Waxin came in to dress my wound,
some of the other nurses sometimes came out of
curiosity, as the working of the brain was quite
visible. The pushing in of long pieces of lint and
the removal of splinters, which took place every
morning, was quite painless, and only took a few
minutes. But it usually took the two nurses half
an hour to dress the various wounds of the new
arrival, and on the first morning Dr Debu extracted
a bullet from just under the skin below the small
of the patient's back.</p>

<p>Shortly after Wilkinson's arrival a most tragic
event took place in the adjoining ward.</p>

<p>In some mysterious manner the electric bells
ceased to ring every evening about nine o'clock.
This was a very serious matter, especially as the
night nurse that particular week&mdash;Mme.&nbsp;Z&mdash;was
very slack about her duties, and never went round
the hospital during the night to see if all was well.
The disturbance started about eleven o'clock, with
a dull thud as of a body falling, followed by shouting
and rattling of the iron tables on the floor of
the ward. The noise, heard through closed doors,
was sufficient to wake Wilkinson. The shouting
ceased for a moment, only to start afresh with new
vigour. Wilkinson took two hops across the room
and opened the door; the tables still rattled, and
the calls for help continued. A French soldier,
with one arm in a sling, clothed in nothing but
<a class="pagenum" name="page_105" title="105"> </a>
a nightshirt, came walking gingerly down the
corridor in his bare feet. When he saw our door
open, he came in to tell us all about it. A soldier
who was badly wounded in the head had suddenly
become delirious, torn off his bandages, and fallen
out of bed. There was no one in the ward able
to help the poor fellow, who lay moaning on the
floor in a state too awful for description. The
bells did not ring, and there was nothing to be
done except shout. The French soldier went
along the corridor to the head of the staircase to
call for the night watcher. After quite a long
time some one downstairs woke up to the fact
that there was something wrong. The night
nurse appeared, followed by the night porter.
They lifted the dying man on to the bed, bandaged
up his poor head, and gave him a strong
injection of morphia. One of the French
soldiers told me some time after that the poor
fellow died quite noiselessly in the middle of the
night, but I knew early that morning when a
stretcher passed the glass door that the tragedy
was over.</p>

<p>Mlle. Waxin used often to tell me about the
different cases under her charge.</p>

<p>I was never able to get the name of one of her
favourites whom she called her "petit anglais."
This was a young Irish boy badly shot in the
stomach. Dr Debu told me that he might live
<a class="pagenum" name="page_106" title="106"> </a>
for several months, but that there was no hope
of recovery. The dressing of his wounds was
nearly always done by Mlle. Waxin, under whose
gentle hand he never complained of the awful
agony from which morphia was the only relief.
Although the ward in which he lay was on the
ground floor, we could sometimes hear the screams
of agony upstairs, screams which no one but Mlle.
Waxin could silence. "C'est mon petit anglais
qui m'appelle," she used to say.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that no matter how badly a
soldier is wounded, even when he can neither eat
nor drink, he will be soothed by a cigarette. The
Frenchman above mentioned, unable to eat, unable
to speak, and scarcely conscious, his brain bleeding
from a great hole in the skull, was yet able the
day before he died to smoke a cigarette. "Le
petit anglais," who was never free from pain, found
his greatest joy in the few cigarettes that Mlle.
Waxin, in spite of the shortage of tobacco, brought
to his beside every morning. It was very hard to
get any tobacco in Cambrai until late in October,
when the Germans allowed it to be imported from
Belgium.</p>

<p>One of the nurses who was able to speak
English used sometimes to come and see me, and
one day she brought me the following note from
a soldier in my own regiment who was in one of
the wards downstairs:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcaps">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was sorry to hear that you had
been one of the unlucky ones, along with myself,
to be put aside and away from the regiment. I
hope that you will pull through all right. I am
getting on, but it is my legs that are all the
hinder. It was a very bad place I was wounded
in the stoumick. Now, dear sir, I hope that you
won't think me forward in asking you for a favour.
If you would let me have the advance of 2s. so
that I could get some tobacco, as I have lost
everything.</p>

<p>This man recovered, and was exchanged many
months afterwards.</p>

<p>Another young Irishman, who was a great
favourite, had been badly wounded in the foot.
It was found necessary to take the foot off, and
after the operation, when Mlle. Waxin went to
console him, she found him lying with his face
to the wall, silently weeping.</p>

<p>"I was going to scold him for being such a
baby," she said to me afterwards, "but when the
English-speaking sister explained to me the reason
of the tears, I felt like crying myself."</p>

<p>"It is not the pain, sister, that troubles me,"
he said to them, "but you see with a wooden leg
I can never go back again to the old regiment."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_108" title="108"> </a>
On 9th Oct. we had a very strict inspection of
the hospital, and a great number of the remaining
British wounded were put down on the list of
"transportables." The French nurses always sent
off the British wounded dressed in French uniform,
as it was a fact notorious at Cambrai that the
Germans robbed British wounded of their uniform.
In many cases German soldiers took greatcoats
away from wounded men and gave a five-mark
piece in exchange. The ill-treatment which was
specially shown to British soldiers on the journey
to Germany was the principal reason why the
French, whenever they could get a chance, disguised
our wounded soldiers in French uniforms.
The fact that, in the early days of the war, British
prisoners were invariably treated worse than the
French cannot be denied, and will be amply
proved from the evidence of returned prisoners,
and from other sources of information at present
unavailable. It is the truth that nearly all British
soldiers taken prisoners and sent to Germany
during the first months of the war were made
the object of special contempt, neglect, or cruelty.
Such conduct undoubtedly constitutes a departure
"from laws of humanity, and from the dictates
of the public conscience," which are supposed to
govern the conduct of civilised
nations.<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> To ill-treat
<a class="pagenum" name="page_109" title="109"> </a>
or insult a wounded and helpless enemy is
the most despicable offence a soldier can commit.
Men who do these things dishonour the name
of soldier.</p>

<p>The meaning of war without chivalry was first
brought home to the inhabitants of Cambrai when
they saw the way the victorious Germans treated
the unfortunate wounded who had been brought
into the town from the neighbouring battlefields.
During the first week of September hundreds of
wounded, French and English, were sent to Germany
packed in cattle trucks, with no medical
attendance, no food, no water. It was only natural
that in our hospital both nurses and patients
should dread the days when German officials came
round searching for cases that could be considered
"transportable." The inspections which
took place on the 9th and 11th of October were
carried out with great severity. My companion
Wilkinson was taken away, and many were put
down on the list who were quite unfit to travel.</p>

<p>Great consternation was created in the hospital
on the evening of the 11th, when an order arrived
that the whole male staff of the hospital was to
report forthwith at the Kommandantur. This was
the end of the Civil Hospital as a French hospital.
The doctors (except Debu), orderlies, and assistants
were marched off to the Kommandantur at seven
o'clock that evening, and spent the whole night
<a class="pagenum" name="page_110" title="110"> </a>
in a cold unfurnished room without food or drink.
Next morning the whole party, with two exceptions,
were told that they were prisoners, and
had to leave at once for Germany. The two
exceptions were one of the surgeons, who was
able to make up a plausible story, and François,
whose wooden leg saved him from a German
prison. Next morning the hospital was taken
over by the Germans, and French orderlies were
replaced by German soldiers.</p>

<p>The operating-room was shared between the
French and German surgeons. Dr Debu operated
in the morning on the French and British, and
in the afternoon the room was occupied by German
surgeons, the chief of whom was Professor Fessler,
a celebrated authority on gunshot wounds. The
French nurses at Cambrai told me that they found
the German surgeons were, as a rule, quite indifferent
and careless in causing pain to the
wounded, of which fact the following incident
from my note-book is an example.</p>

<p>"<i>Oct. 16th.</i>&mdash;Dreadful screams from downstairs,
lasting two or three minutes. Mlle. Waxin tells me
it is only the German surgeon starting to operate
before the ether had taken effect."</p>

<p>An exception must be made of Professor Fessler,
who was always most humane in the operating-room.
Professor Fessler once said to Mlle. Waxin,
"If the men who are responsible for war could
<a class="pagenum" name="page_111" title="111"> </a>
be made to realise the horror of the operating-room,
war would always be avoided." A dying
Frenchman was brought in one afternoon in the
hope that instant operation might save his life.
Professor Fessler performed the operation at once,
working with the utmost care, as Mlle. Waxin told
me, to avoid giving the poor sufferer unnecessary
agony.</p>

<p>The numbers of German patients in the hospital
increased day by day, which we took as a hopeful
indication that the Germans were not having
things all their own way. We had several German
officers about this time, and I used to hear about
them from Mlle. Waxin. One of them, who was
very seriously wounded, insisted upon being dressed
by the French nurse, and would not allow the
Schwester to touch him. The officer in the room
next mine was dying of chest wounds complicated
by pneumonia. During the night, through the
thin partition, I could follow every sound of his
death agony&mdash;the groaning, whistling laboured
breathing, the whispering of nurses, the low steady
tones of prayer, and then silence.</p>

<p>A very different death scene took place in the
hospital a few days later. A German officer was
brought in badly shot in the stomach. After his
operation he was told that food or drink during
the first twenty-four hours would be fatal. He
ordered his servant to fetch him a bottle of champagne,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_112" title="112"> </a>
drank half of it down and died within five
minutes. A bestial and truly Hunnish death.</p>

<p>Now that the Germans had installed themselves
in the hospital, there was an end to the pleasant
afternoons on the sunny terrace. I was no longer
lifted out of bed to sit in a chair, nor was I able
even to sit up in bed lest some German should
see me and mark my name down as "transportable."
The hospital gate was now guarded by
a sentry, and no visitors could enter without a
written permit from the German authorities, who
imposed their authority throughout the whole
hospital, without meeting any effective resistance
until they encountered Mlle. Waxin. German
authority said that a German Schwester would,
in future, assist the French nurse in the operating-room.
Mlle. Waxin declaring that she would
allow no one to interfere with her work, locked
the room up and put the keys in her pocket.
German authority, after threatening imprisonment,
exile, and other dreadful punishments, had to
climb down. It would have been easy to take
the keys or to force the door, but the services of
Mlle. Waxin were indispensable, and it was obviously
impossible to compel her to work against
her will. So the German Schwester was dismissed.
The morning after this matter had been
settled another storm arose, when Mlle. Waxin's
father came to pay his daily visit and was stopped
<a class="pagenum" name="page_113" title="113"> </a>
by the sentry. The determined young girl went
to the German Head Surgeon and declared that
she refused to work in the hospital unless her
father was allowed to visit her at any time of the
day or night without hindrance.</p>

<p>After the first few days the friction between the
French and German hospital staff began to grow
less. The German nurses, although good at sweeping
and cleaning, had little or no training at Red
Cross work, and were very glad to leave the dressing
of complicated injuries to Mlle. Waxin or Mlle.
Debu. The night orderlies were stolid, silent, very
willing and obliging. The German surgeons from
all accounts behaved with tact and courtesy.</p>

<p>This comparatively peaceful state of affairs was
upset by the visit of an extremely ugly, very cross
and disagreeable individual, with a grey ragged
beard, whom we christened "le père grigou." His
chief business at Cambrai was to compile lists of
"transportables." Grigou, a personage of high
rank, was the senior medical officer at Cambrai.
To our great horror he made the Hôpital Civil his
headquarters, and on the day of arrival paid a surprise
visit to my room. But not quite a surprise
visit, for Mlle. Waxin had wind of his coming and
had made all preparations. She bound an extra
bandage round my head, took my pillow away,
and drew the window curtains. When Grigou
arrived I was lying flat on my back in semi-darkness,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_114" title="114"> </a>
breathing heavily. My eyes, bloodshot from
ten minutes' hard rubbing, looked vacantly up at
the ceiling. As Grigou bent over the bed I heaved
a long tremulous sigh. Grigou consulted with his
colleague, and the verdict was that it was doubtful
if I would live till next morning! My name was
of course put down on the list of "non-transportable."
If Grigou, who visited our floor every day,
had seen me, or any German had reported that I
had been seen sitting up in bed, our harmless trick
would have resulted in my immediate departure
for Germany, and my nurses would have got into
serious trouble, so I had to live up to my supposed
dying condition. Grigou did not remain with us
more than a few days, but even when he had
left the nurses did not dare to take me out on a
stretcher or even to put me into a chair.</p>

<p>At this time the other bed in my room was
occupied by a soldier of the Middlesex Regiment.
His case was an example of the terrible results
which came from delay in attending to shell wounds.
After lying out two days he was taken to Cambrai,
and remained for more than a week in a German
ambulance with little or no attention. A German
surgeon opened his leg without using an anæsthetic.
Perhaps there was none to be had. As a result of
this the poor fellow's nerve was completely shattered.
When he came under Dr Debu's care it was
hoped that his leg might be saved, and a further
<a class="pagenum" name="page_115" title="115"> </a>
opening was made just below the knee. The
dressing of this man's wounds was a sight not
easily forgotten. When the nurses entered the
room with the dressing-table he begged them to
leave him to die. While the bandage was being
unrolled he sat with chattering teeth, his face
twitching with nervous apprehension; the leg was
dreadful to look at, the flesh just above and below
the knee lay folded back, raw and discoloured, with
rubber tubing protruding from both sides of the calf.
It was a hopeless case, and the attempt to save his
leg had to be given up. After the amputation he
suffered far less pain, but never recovered his self-control.
On 20th October he was taken away to
Madame Brunet's Convalescent Hospital, reserved
for amputated cases, where he died just before
Christmas.</p>

<p>It had been decided by the German authorities
that beds in the Hôpital Civil were to be reserved
solely for cases requiring operation. Dr Debu
therefore found that it was no longer possible for
me to stay, and arranged for my being sent to
another hospital.</p>

<p>On the 21st October I was taken away from my
kind friends, and for the first time carried by Germans
on a German stretcher. Outside the hospital
a motor ambulance was waiting. The night was
dark, wet, and very cold. My leg was soon numbed
with cold, as the ambulance did not start for nearly
<a class="pagenum" name="page_116" title="116"> </a>
a quarter of an hour. Through the open end I
could see a flickering street lamp which threw
glinting reflections on the wet cobble-stones.</p>

<p>A martial step, with the clink of spurs, woke
echoes down the silent street; a German officer
passed, came into view for an instant under the
lamp, then clanked away into darkness.</p>

<p>The ambulance driver and another soldier, who
had been conversing together in low tones, stood
rigidly to attention until the sound of the officer's
steps had died away in the distance. Then the
French soldier for whom we were waiting was
carried down and placed in the ambulance beside
me, the door was closed, shutting out the cold air
and the dripping street. "Eh bien, mon lieutenant,"
said a voice from the stretcher, "nous voila partis!
My father was taken prisoner in 1870, and voila, I
am now also a prisoner, but that is nothing&mdash;<i>on
les aura</i>, cette fois ci, on les aura ces sales têtes
d'alboches!"</p>

CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="small">LE NUMÉRO 106.</span></h2>


<p>The school building, hurriedly transformed on
the outbreak of war into a hospital, forms three
sides of a quadrangle, the fourth side of which is
blocked by a high wall, so that in the courtyard
thus formed the sun can never shine.</p>

<p>This was the hospital of the French Red Cross&mdash;L'Hôpital
Auxiliaire du Territoire, No.&nbsp;106, Union
des femmes de France. The accommodation for
patients is limited to five rooms, all of which look
on to the dismal courtyard. "Salle un," to which
I was taken on arrival, the only room at all
resembling a hospital ward, is a long lofty room
running the whole length of one side of the
quadrangle.</p>

<p>Along each side of the room beds of various sorts
and sizes were ranged several yards apart. Mine
was a large and brand-new double bedstead with
large ornamental brass knobs. The sheets were of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_118" title="118"> </a>
the finest Cambrai linen. Under several layers
of blankets, and surrounded on all sides by
hot bricks wrapped in flannel, I soon began to
recover from the effects of my journey in the
ambulance.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck me about my new
quarters was the number of nurses and orderlies,
most of whom were local volunteers whose experience
of hospitals dated from the German invasion.
They were relieved from night work by a number
of extra volunteers attached to the hospital, who
each took one night a week.</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <p class="caption">
  L'Hôpital "106."</p>
</div>

<p>It was now past eight o'clock, the nurses had
all left, and the night staff&mdash;three youths from the
city&mdash;had taken off their bowler hats, retaining their
coats and mufflers, and sat themselves at a table
near the door. At the far end of the ward a tall
young German soldier sat working silently at his
table far into the night. He belonged to the motor
transport, and was suffering from earache&mdash;so much
I had gathered from the nurses. I speculated that
perhaps he was working to pass examinations for
a commission; the little lamp burning late, the
absorbed attitude of the student, seemed incongruous
in such surroundings. In the bed opposite
mine lay a badly-wounded German officer, shaded
by a screen from the lamp round which the night-watchers
sat reading. These were the only two
Germans in the hospital. Presently the studious
<a class="pagenum" name="page_119" title="119"> </a>
German put aside his books, retired to bed, and
the ward was silent. The services of the orderlies
did not seem to be required,&mdash;one sat for a while
aimlessly turning over the leaves of an illustrated
paper, then rested his head awhile upon the table,
and was at once asleep. From the bed opposite
there came a gentle tinkling sound. One of the
watchers, a young lad, still a schoolboy, crossed
the ward on tiptoe and bent over the wounded
man, whose whisper was too feeble to reach my
listening ear. The light was turned on, the sleeper
resting on the illustrated paper awoke, left the
ward, and returned after a few minutes with the
night nurse. Now that the screen was moved I
could see that the face in the bed opposite was
that of a young man, perhaps not more than nineteen;
it was the face of a gentleman and a soldier,
but drawn, pinched, more yellow than reality in
the gaslight, gasping with pain, gasping for morphia.
When at last the merciful injection had been given,
"Merci, merci," said a strengthened voice; "merci,
vous êtes tous si bons pour moi." The screen
replaced, the gas turned low, the watchers returned
to their table, and all was quiet again till
dawn.</p>

<p>Next morning just before ten o'clock the ward
was visited by two surgeons, one a German, the
other my friend from the Hôpital Civil, Dr Debu.
By the dull light of a wet October morning they
<a class="pagenum" name="page_120" title="120"> </a>
examined the wounded German officer. From
Dr D.'s face I knew the case was hopeless. Still,
an operation might save life, if not the leg. When
the stretcher-bearers came to carry the young
officer away he thanked the nurses for their kindness,
speaking perfect French with pathetic accents
of real gratitude. He asked that the chocolates,
cigarettes, &amp;c., on his table should be distributed
among the French soldiers in the ward, and again
expressed his thanks, and asked pardon for the
trouble he had caused. The operation was unsuccessful.
He was taken, such are the coincidences
of life and death, to the same bed as I had occupied
at the Civil Hospital&mdash;numéro sept&mdash;where a few
days afterwards he died, but not before his mother,
in mourning already for two sons, had been called
from Germany to his bedside.</p>

<p>No special accommodation was provided for
officers at the 106 Hospital. There was a French
officer in Salle 5, on the ground floor, and it was
arranged that I was to be taken downstairs to his
ward.</p>

<p>The worst ward in the hospital was undoubtedly
No.&nbsp;5. The room had formerly been a classroom
for junior pupils. Poor little children! how miserable
their lessons must have been in that damp
sunless schoolroom. On the courtyard side, facing
north, the light is obscured by a large wide verandah;
on the south side the ground of another small
<a class="pagenum" name="page_121" title="121"> </a>
courtyard is five or six feet higher than the level of
the room.</p>

<p>Of the Salle cinq I have many pleasant memories,
but my first impression of it&mdash;a picture which I
cannot forget&mdash;was sadly depressing. The room is
a small one, not more than 36 by 20 feet. One
had the impression of entering a basement, almost
a cellar. The windows were all shut. Judging
from the heavy fetid atmosphere, they had not
been opened since the declaration of war.</p>

<p>Except for a small open area in the centre,
the whole floor-space was filled with beds,
which were ranged all round the room, each one
close up against the other. In the corner next
the door one bed, standing by itself, was occupied
by the French officer, X., a reserve Captain of the
Colonial Infantry. My bed was also a corner
one. On one side stood a cupboard in which
bandages, morphia, and other necessaries were
kept.</p>

<p>Salle 5 was not only the worst ward, but it also
contained the worst cases. This was probably
owing to the fact that the nurse in charge,
Mme. Buquet, was the most efficient nurse in
the hospital. The number of beds was thirteen.
No.&nbsp;1, known as "le Picard," was a cheery, jovial,
hardy little fellow, who had lost a leg. No.&nbsp;2,
Sergt. Blanchard, suffered from a badly suppurating
wound in the thigh, and was taken away for
<a class="pagenum" name="page_122" title="122"> </a>
an operation to the Civil Hospital, where he died
a few days after. No.&nbsp;3, Chasseur Alpin, shot
through the chest about an inch above the heart. A
very serious case. No.&nbsp;6, left arm amputated, right
leg and foot shattered. Nos. 8 and 9, very bad gangrenous
leg wounds. Both died shortly afterwards.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p122i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">
  M. Vampouille in the Salle Cinq.</p>
</div>

<p>Under the circumstances it was perhaps only
natural that on my arrival into the Salle cinq I
was rather depressed. Most of the poor fellows
in the ward were in continuous pain, but the only
one who made audible complaint was No.&nbsp;6.
This man was a Charentais from Cognac. His
wounds, although very terrible, were yet not so
bad or so painful as those of many others who
suffered in silence. No.&nbsp;6 never ceased day or
night, except when under the influence of morphia,
from groaning and whining about his foot; he was
known in the ward as "Oh mon pied!" On the
afternoon of my arrival No.&nbsp;6 came near to death&mdash;nearer
even than he did on the day when a
German shell blew off his arm and destroyed most
of his right leg. No.&nbsp;6 was sitting propped up in
bed, when suddenly his head fell back, his thin
yellow face turned a pasty white, and he lay back
apparently a corpse. Fortunately an orderly was
in the room at the time, and help was immediately
forthcoming. About a dozen nurses crowded round
the bed. There was nothing to be done. The
doctor was sent for, also the Curé. "The man
<a class="pagenum" name="page_123" title="123"> </a>
was dying;" "he was dead." "No, he still
breathed." Then some one made an intelligent
suggestion. "Look inside the bed." The bedclothes
pulled down revealed a dreadful sight,
which explained at once what had happened.
The whole bed was soaked in blood. A blood-vessel
had burst in the wound and the man was
bleeding to death. The bleeding was easily
stopped by the application of a tourniquet, but
it was doubtful if any man could live after the
loss of so much blood. Doctor and Curé arrived
together as No.&nbsp;6 was beginning to come round.
The tourniquet had been applied just in time.</p>

<p>No windows were left open during the night.</p>

<p>Café au lait came in next morning at 7.30, and
was distributed by Pierre, the orderly, a most
willing and really excellent fellow. During breakfast
one window was opened about three inches.
As soon as breakfast was over the window was
closed, the breakfast things removed, and the
nurse began to prepare for the morning's work.</p>

<p>Mme. Buquet, head nurse of the ward, wife of a
well-known French surgeon, was assisted by two
volunteers from Cambrai, Mlle. Marie and Mlle. X.
The dressing of wounds is quite a simple, straightforward
business when the wounds are clean, but
it is a very different story when there is gangrenous
infection. No.&nbsp;1, "le Picard," whose bed was just
opposite mine, gave no trouble; his stump had
<a class="pagenum" name="page_124" title="124"> </a>
nearly healed up and required very little attention.
A deal of time was given to No.&nbsp;3, the
Chasseur Alpin; the bullet wound had made a
small hole just over the left nipple, and the
dressing of it was most painful to watch, as the
poor boy evidently suffered great agony, though
he never cried out or complained. No.&nbsp;6 provided
what one might call "le pièce de résistance."
He began to howl before he was touched,
and during the whole time his wounds were being
dressed he continued either to shout or groan, or
repeat his favourite exclamation, "Oh mon pied,
mon pied!" Picard used to jeer at him for making
so much fuss. "There is no one in the ward
who makes such an infernal row as you do." No.&nbsp;6
replied that no one in the ward suffered so much
pain. This statement met with vigorous opposition
from all over the room; even No.&nbsp;3, who
could scarcely breathe, was roused for the first
time to husky speech. "Some of us suffer in
silence: you should do likewise." In the heated
discussion which followed No.&nbsp;6 forgot for a time
all about his bad foot. Poor No.&nbsp;6 was in a
minority of one. He was told that, though we
were all very sorry for him, we objected to the
continual groaning and shouting, which could do
no good, and only disturbed those who suffered
far worse pain in silence.</p>

<p>Nos. 8 and 9, the two beds nearest to mine,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_125" title="125"> </a>
were the last to be dressed that morning. No.&nbsp;9,
whose bed was so close to mine that there was
only just room between for the nurse to stand,
was badly shot in the upper part of the thigh.
The wound was in such a condition that there
was no hope of recovery. A stream of dark-green
gangrenous liquid poured out of the wound
at the first washing. I covered up my head under
the sheets and lit a cigarette, but even so could not
escape from the sickening smell.</p>

<p>Owing to the serious condition of most of the
wounded, the limited number of surgical instruments,
and the cramped space in which the work
had to be done, the dressing of wounds went on
the whole morning, and was seldom finished before
midday. During all this time the windows were
kept shut, until just immediately before lunch,
when one window was opened&mdash;not too wide, lest
too much of the foul putrid atmosphere should
escape and let in some of the clean air of a fresh
autumn morning.</p>

<p>After lunch, M.&nbsp;le Médecin Chef Faméchon and
Capt. Viguié came to pay us a visit. The Médecin
Chef is a man between sixty and seventy years of
age, tall, straight as an arrow, dignified, reserved,
almost austere in manner, <i>au fond</i> the kindest
and best of men, as I found out later on from
personal experience. He was taken prisoner at
Arras, and now remained a prisoner in this hospital.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_126" title="126"> </a>
Thus do the Germans observe the Geneva
Convention.</p>

<p>The Médecin Chef and Captain Viguié shared
a small room at the other side of the hospital.
Viguié, who had formerly occupied my bed in
Salle 5, used to come every morning to visit his
old friends. The visits were always an occasion
for the exchange of humour between Viguié and
myself, in which combats Viguié, possessed of a
Parisian quickness of repartee, always came off
best. Perhaps it was the case as Mme. Buquet
said, that I suffered from "du retard dans la perception."
We all used to tease Viguié, and I used
to greet him in the morning as "vieux coco."
"Dites donc, Monsieur l'Ecossais," was the usual
answer; "nous n'avons pas gardé les cochons
ensemble." It has taken nearly a year and a
half to find the correct answer to this pleasantry&mdash;an
answer which I could send to my friend in
his German prison, only that the Boche might
refuse to pass it. "Non, mon ami, mais nous
avons été gardé ensemble par les cochons!"</p>

<p>My diary states that "on October 26th I got
up in the evening and had dinner at the table.
There is great excitement in the hospital on
account of large bodies of German troops having
passed through the town. This is supposed to
be a retirement." This opinion was strengthened
by the visit of a simple-minded citizen of Cambrai,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_127" title="127"> </a>
who came in with the news that "Metz had
fallen." Stupid stories such as these were believed
for a time by a great many people. "The smell
in my ward is not so strong to-night. I have
succeeded in getting a window kept open."</p>

<p>"October 30th. M.&nbsp;Heloire, the Veterinary
Surgeon from Caudry, came to see me yesterday."
Perhaps it was because he was not wearing
the white overall that I did not recognise
the tall, erect, grey-bearded man, who stood at
the door of the Salle cinq and looked anxiously
round the ward. Presently he came over to my
bedside and stood looking. Then he spoke some
commonplace, but not until he mentioned Caudry
did I realise who it was. Labouring under a
racial disability, I struggled to express my gratitude,
but M.&nbsp;Heloire put an end to my efforts.
With tears rolling down his cheeks he embraced
me tenderly and thanked the <i>Bon Dieu</i> that I was
still alive. "They said at Caudry that you had
died on the way to Germany, and so I came to
ask the truth as soon as I could get a permit."
We talked of many things, and M.&nbsp;Heloire refreshed
my memory as to many incidents of my
short stay at Caudry which I had forgotten. He
told me among other things that when I was
carried on a stretcher out of La Maison Camille
Wanecq and put into the cart, the villagers standing
by, who were not quite sure if my immediate
<a class="pagenum" name="page_128" title="128"> </a>
destination was to be the hospital or the churchyard,
were overcome with astonishment at my
exclaiming, as the stretcher was lifted on to the
cart, "En route la marchandise!" "Every day,"
went on the old man, "for days after you had
left, my little granddaughter, who is only eight
years old, begged to be taken to the place where
grandpère had found the poor wounded officer.
One Sunday afternoon, when it was fine, we
went for a walk along the road that you must
so well remember&mdash;the cart road from Caudry to
Beaumont. When we reached the place, the ditch
by the roadside, where, the morning after the
battle, after much searching, I found you lying,
my little girl, asking me to show her exactly where
you had rested, picked from the spot some of the
grass and a few common wild flowers to keep as
a souvenir of grandpapa's wounded soldier."</p>

<p>On that same evening, after M.&nbsp;Heloire had
gone, I made another friend, M.&nbsp;Vampouille, a
Belgian, the proprietor of a small pork-butcher's
business, Rue de l'Arbre d'Or, Cambrai. M.&nbsp;Vampouille
worked in the hospital during the
day when his business would permit, took one
night a week in the Salle cinq, and was to me
a faithful and devoted friend, to whom I never
can hope to express as I would my admiration
and deepest gratitude. Vampouille himself would
be much astonished to hear me express such
<a class="pagenum" name="page_129" title="129"> </a>
sentiments, for the kindness which always took
thought and trouble, the tact and common-sense
which made his companionship so agreeable, are
natural virtues of which he is wholly unconscious.</p>

<p>At the 106 we had no restrictions as to visits;
at all hours of the day numbers of people used to
visit the wards, many came out of curiosity, and
such visits were for me at any rate a penance,
chiefly owing to the prevailing mania for shaking
hands. At times whole families, dressed all in
deep mourning, would drift into the room and
stand awkwardly grouped at the foot of my bed.
"Allons ma petite Françoise, va dire bonjour à ce
brave soldat," and the whole tribe would come, one
after the other, to perform the ceremony of "le
shake-hand." After this function followed the
inevitable question, "Where were you wounded?"</p>

<p>My method of dealing with this question always
amused Mme. Buquet.</p>

<p>"Où avez-vous été blessé?"</p>

<p>"A Caudry."</p>

<p>"Oui! mais à quel endroit avez-vous été blessé?"</p>

<p>"A l'entrée du village!"</p>

<p>"Oui, mais dans quelle parti avez-vous été blessé?"</p>

<p>"In the head, that is why I wear these bandages."</p>

<p>"Go, Françoise, say au revoir to the poor
wounded soldier."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_130" title="130"> </a>
The function of le shake-hand having been re-enacted
by each member of the family, they passed
on to the next bed.</p>

<p>I had many friends whose welcome visits helped
to break the monotony of hospital life. Mlle.
Waxin and Mlle. Debu used sometimes to come
and talk to their old "Numéro Sept," and tell
me all the latest news. From them I first heard
of poor Captain Lloyd, an English officer very
seriously wounded, who occupied my old room in
the Hôpital Civil. I wrote a short note to Lloyd,
expressing my sympathy, and next morning, when
Dr Debu made his daily visit to the ward, I asked
him to take it back with him.</p>

<p>There must be some special department of the
German Staff solely occupied with the task of
thinking out new things to make <i>verboten</i>. It is
incredible, but true, that the Germans had forbidden
any intercommunication between wounded
and dying soldiers in the different hospitals, and
so my correspondence with Lloyd was carried
on secretly through the kind offices of Madame
Buquet. Owing to her knowledge of German,
Mme. Buquet was able to obtain a permit to visit
the Hôpital Civil, and every day at 2&nbsp;<span class="small">P.M.</span>, instead
of taking her daily walk, she went to visit poor
Lloyd, who was feeling rather lonely, and longed,
as he said in one of his letters, to talk once more
to a fellow-countryman.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_131" title="131"> </a>
It was after dinner on All Saints' Day, November
1, that I made my first attempt to walk without
any one's help. I got outside the ward and along
to a door which led into the courtyard. The night
was clear and still, the wind cold and restless. I
stood awhile on the wet gravel of the court, looking
up once again at the clouds playing among
stars by the light of a rising moon.</p>

<p>"Vous n'êtes pas fou," said a voice from the
doorway. "We looked for you everywhere; you
will catch your death of cold out there in the
dark."</p>

<p>"You cannot understand," I replied, "how good
it feels to stand once more on the soil of the earth
and look up into the heavens."</p>

<p>Two of the worst cases, Nos. 8 and 9, were taken
away during the night to the Civil Hospital for a
fruitless operation. In the afternoon, it being La
Fête des Morts, Madame Buquet went to the military
cemetery. Even the frozen soul of a German
staff officer could not forbid the citizens of Cambrai
to visit their dead.</p>

<p>In the military cemetery of Cambrai, visited on
this day by crowds of mourners, the French and
British soldiers are buried together in a common
tomb, under a single wooden cross. There are
several such tombs in the cemetery, and each
to-day is covered with wreaths. A row of long
black crosses, with name and regiment painted in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_132" title="132"> </a>
white on each, marks the resting-place of the
officers. The same order prevails in the German
quarter of the churchyard.</p>

<p>In all the surrounding countryside at Caudry,
at Le Cateau, in village churchyards, in open fields
by country roadsides, beside the plain wooden
cross which marks the soldier's grave, some
one to-day has laid a wreath and knelt in
prayer.</p>

<p>At this time large numbers of troops were constantly
passing through the city, coming from the
direction of St&nbsp;Quentin and leaving in that of
Valenciennes, from which point they proceeded to
reinforce actual or impending attacks on Arras
and Ypres. According to the universal opinion
of Cambrai, the departure of the Germans from
the city was to be expected at any moment.</p>

<p>The sound of the cannonade at Arras could be
heard quite distinctly, and when the wind was
favourable the boom of the big guns seemed nearer
than ever. "They were coming nearer," said the
citizens of Cambrai with mutual congratulations.
The inevitable morning salutation now became,
"Bonjour, bonjour; the guns sounded nearer last
night and they will soon be here&mdash;listen! comme
ça roule."</p>

<p>A gentle westerly wind carried to our ears the
sound of the distant guns, like an echo of a distant
thunderstorm.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_133" title="133"> </a>
One evening, late in November, a still clear
night, when the cannonade could be heard more
distinctly than usual, Captain Viguié and I stood
out in the yard for a long time listening. To the
long loud rumble of the German cannon we could
hear, after an interval, a faint and more distant
answer&mdash;an answer that spoke, as it were, in
another tongue. It was the French 75!</p>

<p>It was obvious to those who did not yield to vain
hopes that the German occupation of Cambrai was
being organised on a permanent basis. Very few
German soldiers remained billeted in the town.
Numbers of them were constantly coming back on
short leave from the front, and from them the story
of the new trench war gradually became known to
us all.</p>

<p>The Military Governor of Cambrai occupied the
Town Hall, now known as the Kommandantur.
The French préfet having fled the city on the
approach of the enemy, a successor was appointed
by the Kommandant, and the administration of
the city proceeded under German supervision and
according to the usual German methods. Edicts
were published at regular intervals declaring some
new thing to be verboten, and always under penalty
of death. Such things as bicycles and sewing-machines
were requisitioned and might not be
retained under penalty of death. Any person at
Cambrai or in the district found, after a certain
<a class="pagenum" name="page_134" title="134"> </a>
date, in possession of pigeons of any kind would
be condemned to death.</p>

<p>The old Cathedral had belonged for years to the
pigeons, who, suspecting no danger, fell an easy
prey, and for several days afforded fine game to the
German sportsmen. Mlle. Marie, who passed the
Cathedral every morning on her way to the hospital,
told me that there were still a few survivors
who, having learnt the lesson of their comrades'
fate, circled high round the Cathedral tower or remained
anxiously perched on some lofty gargoyle.</p>

<p>The "Cambrai" pigeons were presented to the
Hôpital 106 by the Secretary of the Kommandantur,
and thus did not meet with the final indignity
of being eaten by the enemy.</p>

<p>A typical illustration of German morality is
afforded by an edict which was published in
Cambrai towards the end of November. All
able-bodied Frenchmen were ordered to present
themselves at the Kommandantur on a certain
date, and were to be sent to Lille to dig
trenches. Only a small number of men presented
themselves on the appointed day, and
were offered the job of digging trenches at five
francs per day. Those who refused would be
sent to Germany. Not more than twenty or
thirty men accepted the proffered wage, and the
remainder were sent to a German prison. Owing
to the failure of the citizens to respond in sufficient
<a class="pagenum" name="page_135" title="135"> </a>
numbers to this demand, the town of Cambrai
was fined a large sum of money.</p>

<p>A declaration, printed in French and German,
of which I have seen a copy, was posted all over
Cambrai under the heading, "Who is responsible
for this Terrible War&mdash;<span class="smcaps">England</span>." Only
the German mind could have produced such an
extraordinary document, in which England is
accused, among other crimes, of "having abandoned
Belgium to her fate." Most of the French
population of Cambrai were much entertained
by the clumsy anti-British propaganda which
emanated from the Kommandantur.</p>

<p>Another large poster appeared in all parts of
the town stating that the British had been convicted
of using Dumdum bullets. A British rifle,
with ammunition, was on show in a shop window
in the market-place, and the German soldier in
charge explained to those who stopped to look
that the hollow thumb-piece of the cut-off of the
British rifle had been designed explicitly for the
purpose of manufacturing dumdum bullets. By
inserting the point of a bullet into the recess and
giving the cartridge a rapid jerk, the pointed end
broke, leaving a square ragged surface.</p>

<p>In their dealings with the civilian population of
Cambrai the Germans showed how they utterly
failed to understand the French mind.</p>

<p>Salle cinq vastly enjoyed the visit of a certain
<a class="pagenum" name="page_136" title="136"> </a>
German officer who came ostensibly to inspect,
but in reality for purposes of propaganda. The
man's name is unknown to me. He was always
referred to among ourselves as <i>l'imbécile</i>. He
was so short of stature that the long Prussian
cloak reached almost to the ground, and a more
fatuous face I have seldom seen on any man. He
spoke French fluently but ungrammatically, and
with a pronounced German accent. "Ponjour,
Matame; here we are all French, is it not? Your
so beautiful Paris I so much admire." The "imbecile,"
having gone round the ward, stood at the
bottom of my bed facing the centre of the room,
and entered into amiable conversation with Mme.
Buquet and the other nurses.</p>

<p>He held forth at some length on the amenities
of Cambrai, and expressed delight that the fortunes
"of this terrible war" had been the occasion
of his meeting and learning to love still more the
French people, whom he had always held in such
esteem.</p>

<p>"It is not the French who are the real enemies
of Germany. If we had not been forced to do so
by the treacherous English, never would we have
invaded the soil of France. Ah, those English,
what barbarians, what uncultured savages, such
different types from those I see around me here!"</p>

<p>At this point Mme. Buquet, catching my wink
from behind the "imbecile's" back, nearly exploded
<a class="pagenum" name="page_137" title="137"> </a>
with laughter, which she, however, managed
to turn into a coughing fit, and the Salle cinq
listened eagerly for more.</p>

<p>We heard the whole pathetic story of how
Germany had been goaded into war. Paris now
was safe. The German armies thirsted solely for
English blood. When England had been crushed,
then France and Germany would fall into each
other's arms and all would be forgiven and
forgotten.</p>

<p>The "imbecile" departed, satisfied that he had
sown good seed. Mme. Buquet, with tears rolling
down her cheeks, was too exhausted for laughter.
The Salle cinq remained silent for a while, stunned
by this wonderful exhibition of stupidity.</p>

<p>Picard, the one-legged soldier, idiomatically expressed
the thought of the Salle. "Eh bien, il
n'a pas peur celui là," which remark might be
translated: "Fools rush in where angels fear to
tread."</p>

<p>The Inspecting Officer, who came round every
two or three days, was General Oberarzt Schmidt.
In addition to this more or less regular visit, there
was another doctor named Meyer, who was charged
with making up lists of "transportables." Every
one naturally wished to put off the evil hour of
departure to Germany as long as possible, especially
as hopes were still entertained by many that the
French troops would drive the Germans out before
<a class="pagenum" name="page_138" title="138"> </a>
Christmas. Meyer only paid one visit to the Salle
cinq, on which occasion its inhabitants appeared
all to be on the point of death!</p>

<p>The list of Salle cinq showed that there were
ten French and one British. Meyer stopped at
the foot of my bed and turned his cold cod-fish
eyes at me. His finger reached for pencil and
note-book. Mme. Buquet saved my name from
going on his list by declaring that my paralysis
was such that I could neither move nor speak.
The cod-fish eyes looked hard at me: "Können
Sie Deutsch verstehen?" I gazed at him with
dropped jaw and vacant eyes, shaking my head
very slightly. There were no "transportables"
that day from the Salle cinq.</p>

<p>Meyer was cordially detested by the whole
hospital staff, by reason of the contemptuous
insolence of his manner. His hatred of the
English was fanatical. Mme. Buquet once asked
him if there was any prospect of an exchange.
"Of the French, yes," he replied; "of the English,
never!"</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <p class="caption">
  General Oberarzt Schmidt, Königliche Erste Bayrische<br />Reserve Corps.</p>
</div>

<p>General Oberarzt Schmidt, a very different type,
was a tall, big-framed, and full-bodied man, large
in the belly, bulging at the neck, with a pinky-red
face and a large square head, bald on top, fringed
with short-cut grey-blond hair. He spoke no
English, and only a half-dozen words of French.
It would be difficult to find an attractive feature
<a class="pagenum" name="page_139" title="139"> </a>
in the face of General Oberarzt Schmidt. The
large mouth which droops shapelessly to one side
is decorated on the upper lip with a few clipped
badly-grown blue-grey bristles. The eyes, small
and shifting, are almost colourless. Whatever his
true character may have been, to us at the 106 he
was always courteous and well-behaved. He used
to come to the Salle cinq every week, and often
remained to talk to Mme. Buquet, who, owing
to her fluent knowledge of German, was able to
obtain from Dr Schmidt a certain amount of
latitude regarding the question of the "transportables."
It was thanks to Mme. Buquet that
the two French captains, whose wounds were
completely healed, were able to remain at 106
for several weeks after they were fit to travel.</p>

<p>At the Hôpital Civil, the German weekly inspection,
when carried out by such men as
Grigou, was a merciless visitation, and for those
whose names went on the list there was no reprieve.
But at the 106 we suffered from no such
unreasoning severity. Doctor Schmidt was often
induced to postpone the departure of any soldier
really unfit for the journey.</p>

<p>"'Tetanus' made the night hideous with groaning
and moaning, so that no one could get any
sleep." This entry in my diary refers to a young
Breton soldier who was isolated in a room opposite
the Salle cinq. The word "room" gives a wholly
<a class="pagenum" name="page_140" title="140"> </a>
wrong impression of the place where this unfortunate
man had to be put. In one corner
stood an old and useless bath, in another two
broken bedsteads; the rough flooring was littered
with rubbish. The walls had never been papered,
the plaster still hung in patches, cracked and
yellow with damp. A wooden partition half-way
up to the ceiling divided the place off from the
corridor, and thus the moans of the dying man
could be heard distinctly in our room. There was
no other accommodation in the hospital wherein
a patient, such as this one, could be isolated.
Tetanus was very common at Cambrai. We had
eight cases at the Hôpital Civil, six of which died.
Very little treatment could be given, as there was
no anti-tetanus serum to be had. The horror of
tetanus is unique, for there is no disease so insidious,
so sudden in its effects, and so terrible in
its end.</p>

<p>For three days the man lived in a semi-unconscious
condition. The first evening we
could hear him moaning, a low, steady, pitiful
moan. About the middle of the night there was
a sudden silence, then a crash, and a sound of
struggling. M.&nbsp;Vampouille, who was on duty
that night in our ward, rushed across the corridor
and, by the light of a match, bent over the man's
bed. It was empty! From the middle of the
room came again the low moaning sound; the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_141" title="141"> </a>
unfortunate man had struggled out of bed in a
fit. The stitches of his leg, which was amputated
above the knee, had burst, and he lay in a pool
of blood. M.&nbsp;Vampouille's further description of
the scene is too awful to dwell upon. From that
evening of November 4 until the morning of
November 7, almost without a stop day and
night, there came from that room the most
mournful lamentation, loud, deep, and sonorous,
though it came through teeth clenched in the
rigor of the dreadful disease. Through locked jaws
and motionless lips came the sound that expressed
the sole thought of his mind. There is no
phrase or turn of writing that can express the
pitiful, appealing, struggling effort of the dying
soldier to articulate this dying call for his mother.
For three days and three nights, first strong and
loud, then weaker and weaker, his constant call
was "Maman, Maman," expressed in this awful
moaning. On the third day I went in to see him.
A nurse was attempting to force some warm milk
between his teeth, but with no success. It was
better to let him die in peace. He did not look
more than nineteen. Sweat ran in trickles down
the pale face wrinkled in agony. His thick black
hair fell low down over clammy forehead and
temple. The blue-grey eyes stared fixed and
sightless. The moaning was now low and weak,
but one could hear that the call was still for
<a class="pagenum" name="page_142" title="142"> </a>
"Maman, Maman." Early next morning I woke
while it was still dark, sat up in bed and listened.
From somewhere in the hospital there came a
swishing, gurgling sound very like the whistling
noise of a turbine engine. Still half asleep, I
sat wondering what kind of engine it could be.
When day dawned the swishing, whistling noise
had ceased, and the suffering of the poor Breton
boy was over. Mme. Buquet was very late in
coming to the ward that morning. She told me
that the last few minutes before the end were
quite peaceful. M.&nbsp;le Vicaire-Général administered
the Last Sacraments, and Captain Viguié
spoke in the dying man's ear the only earthly
consolation that remained: "Mon garçon, tu
meurs pour la France."</p>

<p>In many respects life in the Salle cinq now
began to be much easier. As a result of my insistent
propaganda in favour of fresh air, I obtained
some small concessions, and succeeded in
obtaining a number of adherents to the policy of
the open window. The worst cases in the ward
had been taken away; those that were left gradually
got better, and even No.&nbsp;6 in the corner began
to improve. In the afternoon I played bridge
with the French captain and some other friends
who used to pay me regular visits, or discussed
the gossip and news of the town with Vampouille.
First of all there was that most excellent M.&nbsp;Herbin,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_143" title="143"> </a>
a big, strong, hearty man, certainly well
past fifty, with honest brown eyes that looked
you straight in the face, showing that his heart
was in the right place, as the saying is. My friend
was a man of few words. "Allons, mon pauvre
vieux, ça va bien hein! la santé?" "Très bien,
mon cher ami." "Tant mieux. Tant mieux."
And the Boches? We used to talk of them.</p>

<p>Cambrai was like a city stricken by the plague.
Most of the shops had their shutters up. No one
went abroad for pleasure, one stayed at home
these days; and the "place publique," with its
German military band which played every day
at 4 o'clock, the café where one used to take the
evening "Pernod"&mdash;such places were now the
haunt of the Boche.</p>

<p>M.&nbsp;Herbin owned a draper's shop, his speciality
was ready-made clothes, and his business was
practically at an end. At the time there was very
little cash in circulation at Cambrai. Notes for
1, 2, and 5 francs were issued by the Town and the
Chamber of Commerce, with an inscription stating
that "this note will be cashed by the Chamber of
Commerce 100 days after the signature of peace."
The German usually paid for everything with
"bons de réquisition." These vouchers were
guaranteed by the German Government only when
stamped by the Kommandantur.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks of the German occupation
<a class="pagenum" name="page_144" title="144"> </a>
officers and men made a practice of entering
shops, taking whatever suited their fancy, and
then, by way of payment, offering the helpless
tradesman a scrap of paper covered with unintelligible
hieroglyphics. These scraps of paper
were absolutely worthless. It was the German
idea of humour thus to rob the unfortunate tradesman
by presenting him in return for his merchandise
with a written statement certifying "the
bearer of this is a silly fool." A still more Germanic
humour found its expression in coarse vulgar filth.
When the bewildered shopkeepers brought their
promises to pay to the Kommandantur for verification
they were greeted with jeering laughter.
German humour finds its happiest element in all
that concerns the lowest functions of the body, and
doubtless the story of such vulgar jests at the
expense of a helpless enemy were repeated with
much gusto by the elegant fraus of the Fatherland.</p>

<p>Among other visitors whom I was always glad
to see were M.&nbsp;et Mme. Ray. The latter used to
come to the Salle twice a week during the afternoons,
so that Mme. Buquet could get off duty.
Mme. Ray was an incorrigible optimist. Every
movement of German troops, whether entering
or leaving Cambrai, she always referred to as a
retirement. Whenever the wind changed and the
sound of guns was more distinctly heard&mdash;the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_145" title="145"> </a>
French were advancing. On Christmas day, she
used to tell me, we will be "in France." I rather
think that these opinions were expressed for the
purpose of cheering up the Salle cinq, for Mme.
Ray was too sensible a woman in other matters
to be in reality so lacking in judgment in this
particular case.</p>

<p>M.&nbsp;Vampouille came every afternoon, except
when detained by his business, which at this time
consisted chiefly in killing pigs to make sausages
for the German soldiers&mdash;sausages which they had
to pay for in hard cash, as Vampouille always refused
to deal in vouchers. My kind friend never
came to see me without a "surprise," a little
parcel which he brought in his pocket&mdash;a slice
of "pâté," or ham, or "saucisson à l'aile," and
many other tit-bits.</p>

<p>During these days there was a great scarcity
of decent tobacco, although there was plenty of
what was called "Belgian tobacco." It is difficult
to suggest what this stuff might have been. It
was sold in large square parcels, covered with blue
paper, labelled "Tabac Belge," and cost one franc
for a very large-sized packet. Once a week a
woman came into the hospital yard bearing on
her back a large basketful of tobacco, cigars, and
matches with which she had travelled on foot from
Belgium. The cigars only cost three sous for two.
I never made any attempt to smoke them, but
<a class="pagenum" name="page_146" title="146"> </a>
once out of curiosity I dissected one and made
a strange discovery. The outside leaf was cabbage,
stained dark-brown; it came off quite easily
and disclosed a second and a third cabbage leaf
of a light yellow colour. Inside these three layers
of cabbage leaf was a hard rolled cylinder which,
as it would not unroll, I cut into two pieces with
a sharp knife. The cylinder was filled with small
shavings and dust, whether from fag-ends of cigarettes
or merely from street sweepings, it was
impossible to tell. I have seen a soldier achieve
the wonderful feat of smoking one of these cigars
to its hot and bitter end. This was Picard, the
one-legged man of Salle cinq&mdash;Picard, who
smoked all day and most of the night, quite
indifferent as to the substance he put into his
clay pipe as long as it would produce smoke.</p>

<p>M.&nbsp;Vampouille succeeded where many other
friends had failed. He found a supply of "English
Tobacco." A patriotic marchande de tabac
had buried the most valuable part of her stock
in a back garden rather than let the Boches have
the advantage. There were three four-ounce tins
of Craven Mixture and three boxes of cigars
"Bock." It was indeed a luxury to smoke real
tobacco and real cigars.</p>

<p>"First flakes of snow. Result, windows shut
tight day and night. Next day a stove was put
into the middle of the room, which is now so
<a class="pagenum" name="page_147" title="147"> </a>
stuffy that one can hardly breathe even with the
windows open. To-day, November 16, I began
to walk with two sticks."</p>

<p>My good friends, the two French officers, had
at last to go, and it was a very sad day for us
all. The list of transportables, a short one, included
five or six French soldiers. They made
a very sad picture as they limped painfully out
into the yard and were helped up to a seat in
the ambulance, each one carrying on his back
a large bundle containing socks, a shirt, and as
much meat and bread as could be taken by a
wounded man on such a journey. Mme. Buquet
went down to the station with the two captains.
We were glad to hear that they were given good
berths in a hospital train, and thus were able to
make the long three days' journey in comparative
comfort&mdash;a good fortune which in those days was
invariably denied to British officers, even when
very severely wounded.</p>

<p>On 25th November I got away from the ward
and the fruitless struggle for fresh air by taking
Captain Viguié's bed in the tiny little room shared
with le Médecin Chef. The room was long and
narrow&mdash;perhaps 20 feet by 5,&mdash;with only just
room for two beds, the washing-stand, and a
small table where the doctor and I used to sit
and play piquet&mdash;a game at which I had neither
skill nor luck, for when our games came to an
<a class="pagenum" name="page_148" title="148"> </a>
end the doctor had scored over 5000 points to
the good! A welcome interruption to our card-playing
was the visit of Mme. de Rudnickna, a
charming Polish lady who was nurse at the
Hôpital Notre Dame, where she for many months
nursed two British officers&mdash;Major Johnson and
Lieut. Foljambe, both very seriously wounded.
She saved Lieut. Foljambe's life by careful
nursing, when the doctors had given up hope,
and she did everything that could be done to
make easier the slow decline of Major Johnson,
who, mortally wounded in the spine, lived till
the first day of 1915. Mme. de Rudnickna came
two or three times a week with a delicious
"Chausson au pommes," and sometimes a bottle
of Vin d'Oporto to liven up the grey, dull winter
afternoons. One day she brought me a copy of
'The Times' for November 19th, the first English
newspaper I had seen since August 12th.</p>

</div>

<p>In a much-thumbed copy of the 'Figaro,' dated
October 25th&mdash;a copy which, it was said, had been
dropped from an aeroplane, and which we secretly
circulated from ward to ward&mdash;we read the story
of Ypres, vague reports of which we had heard
from German soldiers, who were told by their
chiefs, and firmly believed, that the objective now
before them was first Calais and then London.
We heard that, once Calais had fallen&mdash;and who
could doubt that it would fall?&mdash;the famous big
<a class="pagenum" name="page_149" title="149"> </a>
guns that had done such deeds at Liége and
Antwerp would batter down the defences of
Dover and sweep a passage across the Channel
for the German troop-ships. It was Bismarck, I
think, who, looking over London from the top
of St&nbsp;Paul's, exclaimed regretfully, "Was für
Plünder!" On this "Plünder" the mind of the
German was now fixed; and soldiers billeted in
the town talked grandly of the punishment to be
inflicted on England for having treacherously
hatched a cowardly plot for the destruction of
the German Empire.</p>

<p>The bulletin of war news, posted up each morning
outside the Kommandantur, boasted each day
of the capture of countless Russian and French
prisoners. One day in November the Cathedral
bells were rung to celebrate the victory of German
arms in the East. All such official displays of
cheerfulness could not hide from our observant
notice that all was not well with the German
armies. The glorious victories always took place
at the other end of Europe.</p>

<p>But nothing was published officially about the
military situation on the Western front. German
soldiers back from the trenches of Arras spoke
bitterly of their failure to capture the French positions.
Rumour said that the German casualties
between Arras and Ypres amounted to over 100,000
killed. Arras was known to us as "Le Tombeau
<a class="pagenum" name="page_150" title="150"> </a>
des Allemands." Reports from Valenciennes told
of crowded hospitals, train-loads of wounded, and
train-loads of dead. Somewhere behind the line
of battle, not very far from Cambrai, there are
large brick-fields. Here it was that a crematorium
was built. A tale was told of trains that passed
in the night, of open trucks in which men, limp
and with nodding heads, stood upright, packed
in close array. By the light of some dim country
station lamp the corpses in their blue-grey uniform
had been seen and recognised, though hidden by
blood and earth, fresh from the field on which they
had fallen. Even for the Boches this was too horrible
an end, to travel in such manner to the grave,
strung together like bundles of asparagus.</p>

<p>At times it would seem as if Martin Luther was
right when he wrote in 1527 that the Germans are
"a heathenish, nay utterly bestial, nation." But
I do not hold with the judgment of this first apostle
of frightfulness. The German nation consists of
the High Command, with its hordes of obedient
slave-drivers, and the rest of the nation, which
in the inner chambers of the High Command is
referred to as the mob&mdash;die Menge. The High
Command is certainly heathenish, and may be
looked upon as utterly bestial, in view of the fact
that they have replaced the elementary principles
of honour by some sort of jungle law of their own
making.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_151" title="151"> </a>
But there are still symptoms of humanity left
in the mob, something of human sympathy and of
the brotherhood of man, which even at Cambrai
made itself felt on rare occasions. Such an occasion
was a visit to the Salle cinq of Herr Arntz. It was
at the time when I was confined to bed, as much
by the fear of Germany as by the paralysis, and on
one of the darkest days of November. Mme. Buquet
sat by my bedside, as she often used to do of an
afternoon when the day's work was over, and spoke
of a German who had called at the hospital a few
days before, asking for her by name. He had
stood out in the corridor waiting for her to come,
bare headed, closely cropped, in the uniform of a
private soldier, and not until he spoke did she
recognise a friend. They had not met for three
years, and the place of their parting&mdash;the Black
Forest in the spring-time. Herr Arntz, then a
young student in chemistry on his holiday tour,
had now passed his degree as Doctor der Chemie.
In spite of weak eyesight and the wearing of blue
spectacles, he had been called up shortly after the
outbreak of war, and was doing railway duty at
Cambrai. So much and more had Mme. Buquet
told me of her friend on that afternoon when he
came again to see her.</p>

<p>It was cold, dark, and inhospitable in the corridor,
and she brought him into the Salle cinq,
where the gas lamps, which had just been lit, gave
<a class="pagenum" name="page_152" title="152"> </a>
the room a touch of homely comfort. Perhaps it
was the Numéro 6 who had called for morphia,
or some other wounded man who required attention,
so that Mme. Buquet left her friend sitting
alone not very far from my bedside. I cherish
no friendly feeling towards any Boche, yet there
was something about this one which commanded
my attention. This was not the manner of our
usual German visitors&mdash;to sit there quietly and
as if ashamed.</p>

<p>I started conversation with a hybrid sentence
in French and German, which encouraged Herr
Arntz to draw up his chair closer to my bed.
There was nothing remarkable in the subject of
our conversation. His attitude towards the war
was that of a fatalist towards an earthquake; he
showed a real sympathy for my state of health
and the effect of my wound, choosing strange and
almost unintelligible phrases in his efforts to speak
the French tongue.</p>

<p>"Ah, mais 'le cerf' il n'est pas touché," then
you will get well. That was good. And to me
when I would speak of der Krieg, "let us forget
it for a moment." How could this quiet gentleman
and I, lying sick, be at war? Was it indeed
wrong, as many said at the 106, thus to converse
with a Boche? Should I have refused my hand at
parting? My friend, so I must call him for his
kindness, lies in an honourable grave somewhere
<a class="pagenum" name="page_153" title="153"> </a>
along the long battle line. A year later, promoted
from guarding railway stations, blue spectacles and
all, he "fell at the head of his company." One
of the mob&mdash;die Menge.</p>

<p><i>St&nbsp;Andrew's Day.</i>&mdash;Captain Lloyd is very much
worse. Mme. Buquet goes to see him every day
at 2&nbsp;<span class="small">P.M.</span>, carrying a note from me and a custard
pudding made by Mme. Tondeur. There was never
a more motherly soul than Mme. Tondeur. And
there never was a cook so excellent and yet so good-tempered,
so pestered with visitors in the kitchen,
yet always smiling and with a kind word for each
one. Wounded men able to hobble out of the Salle
cinq, or down from the other wards upstairs, loved
to sit in a corner of her kitchen and peel potatoes
or wash dishes and listen to the day's gossip.
What with nurses and orderlies, stray visitors from
the town, soldiers on crutches, all congregating in
the kitchen, which might have been the H.Q. of
the hospital, it was indeed a wonder that Mme.
Tondeur could produce such an excellent dinner.</p>

<p>When M.&nbsp;Vampouille, of his own idea and
specially to please me, cured a piece of bacon
à l'anglaise, Mme. Tondeur and I put our heads
together over the cooking of bacon and eggs.
The simple barbarity of English cooking is always
puzzling to French people. My dish, which started
on the range as bacon and eggs, arrived on the
table as an omelette au jambon.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_154" title="154"> </a>
What a sordid thing is a boiled potato in
comparison with "des pommes frites"! We had
fried potatoes one day a week, on which occasion
all available hands were turned on to the work
of peeling and slicing, no unskilled labour, when
wastage is not to be endured. For every ward
there was a large dish piled high, golden,
crisp, and scalding hot and appetising&mdash;good
to take with one's fingers like fine pastry, very
different from the soppy, flaccid, colourless British
imitation.</p>

<p>Every morning Mme. Tondeur prepared the
custard pudding in a small dish, which was then
wrapped up in a napkin ready to be carried by
Mme. Buquet to our poor friend at the Hôpital
Civil. "Ah, mon Lieutenant," she used to say,
"what a joy it is to do something to help, even
if so little. I also have a son in the trenches,
and I pray le bon Dieu to send him back to
me, even with a leg or an arm less I would
not complain. Si seulement je le savais comme
vous!"</p>

<p>Here in England, far from the presence of war,
it is impossible to realise the suffering of these
unfortunate people in the North of France who
have never been allowed to get news from the
trenches, who will not know of the death of husband
or son for months and years after. No correspondence
is allowed even with neutral countries.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_155" title="155"> </a>
Though the land under German occupation is a
place of misery and desolation, it has one redeeming
feature&mdash;there are no pseudo-conscientious
objectors. German invasion and occupation of
Britain would not be too high a price to pay for
the extirpation of this national dry-rot.</p>

<p>One who has lived long months among these
despairing people writes to say how hard it is
for those outside the German zone to realise the
misery of invasion. "Old men and little children
work in the fields with neither horses nor oxen
nor ploughs. In many places German soldiers
plough and sow, desecrating the soil of France....
And when in France I hear it said that the
war is without end, that the strain is too great,
I think of those who live in the invaded districts,
those who are exiled from France under the
enemy yoke and yet do not despair, but wait
with patient confidence for the hour of deliverance;
perhaps they have some right to say the
strain is hard to bear."</p>

<p>I do not envy the man, be he ploughman,
starred tradesman, or merely possessed of a sickly
conscience, who can apply for leave to stay at
home, while old men and little children till
the fields of Northern France without horses,
oxen, or ploughs, under the hard rule of the
Hun.</p>

<p>We were a sad party on that St&nbsp;Andrew's Day
<a class="pagenum" name="page_156" title="156"> </a>
at the Hôpital 106. Mme. Buquet came in the
afternoon rather later than usual to the little
room, where the old Colonel and I sat playing
piquet, bringing sad news from the Civil Hospital.
Poor Captain Lloyd was not expected to live more
than a few hours.</p>

<p>We sat silently while the twilight melted into
darkness. When a friend is dying those that
watch and busy themselves with small services
can find therein some small consolation. But we,
weighed down in mind, powerless to influence in
any degree the inevitable order of fate, found the
pattern of the universe a hard reading.</p>

<p>To die is unimportant and common to all, the
only important thing is the manner of our leaving.
Captain Lloyd, my friend whom I have never seen,
showed how the spirit of a man can rise above
the saddest catastrophe of war and throw a gleam
of light on the apparently hopeless and senseless
maze of human misery.</p>

<p>Mme. Buquet used to come every afternoon
straight back to my room after her visit to the
Hôpital Civil, and her report to me never varied.
"He never speaks of himself, but asks insistently
for news of you." His eyes lit up on hearing
that I could walk with crutches. "Do tell him
to be careful and not try too much;" and to-day,
and on this sad St&nbsp;Andrew's Day, his last words
to Mme. Buquet showed the full measure of unselfish
<a class="pagenum" name="page_157" title="157"> </a>
thoughtfulness: "Do not let him worry,
do not let him know how weak I am."</p>

<p>It was quite dark when M.&nbsp;Vampouille came
in. He would not suffer the darkness even after
hearing the sad story, but lit the gas and kept
a cheery manner. "It is something to know,"
said he, "that there are 'de si braves gens de
par ce monde.'"</p>

<p>St&nbsp;Andrew's Feast was not forgotten that
evening. Monsieur Vampouille had brought me
a scarce and much-valued delicacy which was
prepared with special care by Mme. Tondeur and
served up at dinner as a savoury. There was no
escape from the six large healthy snails sitting in
their shells enthroned on pieces of toast soaked
in oil and vinegar mixed with chopped onions
and garlic.</p>

<p>From Mme. Buquet there was a flower-pot with
some early primroses and a note, "To the Scotch
Lieutenant on St&nbsp;Andrew's Feast Day."</p>

<p>These gracious incidents, as R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson
remarked, are distinctive of the French people,
and "make the ordinary moments of life ornamental."</p>

<p>Also I had almost conquered my insular prejudice
against the eating of snails, which are really
quite succulent when served with such a sauce.</p>

CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="small">STORIES FROM LE NUMÉRO 106.</span></h2>


<p>Behind one of the hospital wings there is a tiny
garden walled in on all sides by high buildings.
Here were some mouldy-looking pear-trees, a
ragged gooseberry bush, and a patch of ragged
cabbage-stalks. The ground was thickly covered
with rotten leaves; in one corner empty broken
rabbit-hutches, pieces of broken furniture, broken
bottles, and miscellaneous <i>débris</i> gave an additional
note of depression. Still it was a change
from the dulness of the courtyard, and the garden,
such as it was, became the object of my daily
excursions. The gardener, now digging trenches
in some distant part of France, might never dig
here again, but his two little children played at
soldiers every afternoon among the decayed leaves.
A large shed at the end of the garden, which had
at one time been used as a wash-house, now falling
to ruin, still contained a rusty boiler and some
<a class="pagenum" name="page_159" title="159"> </a>
broken wash-tubs. In one corner, piled one on
top of the other, stood six or seven roughly-hewn
coffins made out of old packing-cases.</p>

<p>Le Picard was often a partner in these explorations
round the dead garden, and together we
visited the coffins. "Ça voyez vous," said this one-legged
philosopher, "ça c'est le dernier costume."</p>

<p>Entrance to the hospital through an archway
under the building was barred by a massive wooden
<i>portail</i>. One morning, when the bread-cart had
left the gateway open, Picard and I took up our
stand on the threshold and looked out into the
street. The houses opposite the hospital are
modern and uninteresting, walls covered with
dirty white plaster, shutters closed and in need
of paint. Farther down on the right, as you stand
at the hospital door, the street, as it nears the
Place Publique, begins to curve, and here were
old houses with their quaint roofs grouped picturesquely
against the dull sky, where heavy clouds
prepared to renew their steady downpour.</p>

<p>The street was empty. Farther down there are
shops, but they are closed. A German soldier came
clattering along the pavement. Just as he reached
the hospital we two standing at the door caught his
eye and aroused his curiosity to such an extent
that he stopped, stared for a moment, then walked
backwards for quite a long way and nearly bumped
into an officer. A few sad-looking women, carrying
<a class="pagenum" name="page_160" title="160"> </a>
baskets and bundles, stopped in the middle of the
street and feasted their eyes on Picard. "It stirs
the heart," said they, "to see the French uniform."
These poor people made a collection of their scarce
sous and presented Picard with one franc fifty.
The children gathered in such numbers that I had
to ask them to move on for fear of the Germans.</p>

<p>After the children had gone, a little girl, perhaps
ten or eleven years old, came shyly up to the door.
Under a threadbare cloak, which in the cold wind
and rain afforded small protection to her tired little
body, she carried a bundle of picture post-cards.
Her present errand was not concerned with asking
for charity. She came quite near without speaking
or looking up, and stretched out a thin grimy little
hand to give me a two-sous piece. Having given
me the two sous and rendered me speechless with
mixed emotions, she turned to run, but Picard
stopped her. "Wilt thou not show us the pretty
post-cards, my little one?" "That I cannot do,"
came the resolute answer; "they are not mine
to give away, and they cost two sous each to buy."
But I, being obviously the possessor of two sous,
was allowed to see the post-cards, and in exchange
for my two-sous piece chose a view of the Place
Publique.</p>

</div>

<p>At this time the army of occupation at Cambrai
was the 6th Bavarians. On the whole, the behaviour
of the Bavarian soldiers was excellent.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_161" title="161"> </a>
Cases of rioting and drunkenness were rare, and we
heard no stories of atrocities such as the Germans
were guilty of in Belgium.</p>

<p>Picard and I stood at the hospital gate every
morning for several days in succession, and in no
case were we greeted with insults, although I found
later on from personal experience that even a
severely crippled enemy was not safe from the
insulting jests of a German soldier. Of course
we always saluted any officer who passed, and our
salute was always punctiliously returned. Sometimes
a private soldier saluted, and one day two
tall bearded reservists stopped, crossed the street,
and gave me a packet of cigarettes. Next morning
we found the gate closed. A note had been sent
from the Kommandantur stating that "it was forbidden
for soldiers to stand at the door of the
hospital." The watchful "Verboten Department"
scored another point and deprived us of a harmless
amusement.</p>

<p>A German orderly came on the 17th December
with the following strange message: "The General
is coming to inspect the hospital, and wishes to
know if the Scotch officer would be good enough
to wear his uniform." Being deficient of sporran,
glengarry, kilt apron, S.B. belt, brogues, and spats,
my "uniform" consisted of the khaki tunic, kilt,
kilt pin, hose-tops and flashes, grey woollen socks,
and black cloth snow-boots. On a black glengarry
<a class="pagenum" name="page_162" title="162"> </a>
made by M.&nbsp;Herbin to my design I wore the
cap badge, which I had fortunately taken off and
put in my pocket when sitting in the trenches on
the morning of the 26th August. I was making
the best of this strange equipment when the arrival
of the General and his Staff was announced.
They were waiting for me in the corridor outside
the Salle cinq. The picture of this group of
German Staff officers is one not easily forgotten.
I turned slowly in at the door with crutch and
stick, laboriously dragging one leg after another,
rested against the wall, and saluted. Among the
group I recognised Dr Meyer, scowling and ill at
ease; also General Oberarzt Schmidt, who, eager
to show me off as being his own particular prize,
was at once snubbed by the General, and subsided
into a dignified silence. These Staff officers were
all big heavy men of the usual German type, but
the General, small, slimly built, with a light grey
moustache, had an air of distinction that was
almost French. His manner also was tactful and
dignified.</p>

<p>After a preliminary question about my health
and inquiry as to my white hair, which I had to
explain was probably due partly to shock and
partly to my head having been so long bandaged
up, the conversation got beyond the little German
I possessed, and one of the big Staff officers came
to the rescue in fluent but guttural English. They
<a class="pagenum" name="page_163" title="163"> </a>
could not believe that the kilt was worn in the
winter-time, and seemed to think that it was only
a parade uniform. Many questions were asked
about the advantages of the kilt as fighting kit.
I said that it was a very adaptable uniform, good
both for fighting and for running away. This
remark was recognised to be a joke, and translated
as such to the General. I was asked how many
regiments in Scotland wore the kilt, and if all
the Highland regiments were composed of Highlanders.</p>

<p>"No," I said in reply to another question, "we
do not wear trousers even in winter."</p>

<p>"Schrecklich kalt im winter," they repeated,
nodding at each other suspiciously.</p>

<p>With a polite wish for my speedy recovery the
General intimated that the parade was at an end.
The Staff clicked its heels and saluted&mdash;even
Meyer had to swallow his hate and follow the
example of the senior officers.</p>

<p>Outside the corridor, Mme. la Directrice and
some of the nurses were standing at the foot of
the stairs ready to accompany the officers round
the hospital, but the General passed by and went
out into the court without taking any notice.</p>

<p>The inspection was over.</p>

<p>A lady who lives near Caudry came to see me.
She told me that the graves of the British soldiers,
both in the churchyard and in the fields around
<a class="pagenum" name="page_164" title="164"> </a>
the village, are well cared for by the villagers, and
that a large number of identity discs had, with
the consent of the German authorities, been locked
up at the Mairie. Near the little wood between
Audencourt and Caudry, on the spot where we
had dug our trenches on the morning of the 26th
August, there are buried seventeen soldiers and
three officers.</p>

<p>About the middle of December the Médecin Chef
was taken away to Germany.</p>

<p>A number of causes now contributed to make
life at the 106 wholly unendurable. An entire
absence of discipline among the hospital orderlies
and the constant squabbling of the nurses had been
points which the doctor and I used often to discuss
and deplore. Now that the restraining influence
of the doctor's age and rank was no longer with
us, the evils of disorganisation became every day
more apparent. The "Directrice," or head matron
of the hospital, was wholly incapable, and by her
tactless mismanagement set the whole hospital by
the ears. The orderlies grew noisier and more
slovenly every day. Youths who had no occupation
in the hospital, and only appeared at meal-times,
were allowed to air their opinions in endless discussion.
Noisy, chattering visitors strolled in at
all hours of the day, and there was no corner of
the hospital safe from invasion. Quarrels among
the nurses reached such a stage of bitterness that
<a class="pagenum" name="page_165" title="165"> </a>
many were not on speaking terms. Friends whose
kind visits I had always welcomed now came
rarely or not at all. It was evident that such a
state of affairs portended something more serious
than tactlessness or mismanagement. The gossips
of Cambrai were busy with many stories to the
discredit of Mme. la Directrice, but it seemed to
me unreasonable that the voice of scandal should be
concerned with a plain-looking woman the wrong
side of forty. The whole affair may have been
merely foolishness and vanity, but it was certainly
an indiscretion on the part of Mme. la Directrice
to receive in the courtyard of the 106 Hospital,
from the hand of a German orderly, bouquets of
white chrysanthemums presented with the compliments
of a German officer.</p>

<p>Every morning at 11 o'clock I paid a visit to
the Salle cinq. Many of the older inhabitants
had gone, some to Germany, others now rested
in what Picard calls le dernier costume. No.&nbsp;6
still complained unceasingly from his corner bed.
No.&nbsp;3, the Chasseur Alpin with a bullet through
the chest, had recovered from various complications
and was now able to sit up in a chair.
Among the newcomers were three English soldiers.
Ben Steele, a reservist from Manchester, had one
bullet through his arm and one through his leg.
Both wounds were healed, but the leg remained
stiff, swollen, paralysed, and the pain was ceaseless.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_166" title="166"> </a>
The story of his wound is one of those ugly
tales of atrocities committed by individual German
soldiers, for which the German Army, with its
perfect discipline, cannot escape responsibility.
Ben was badly wounded in the arm, and was left
lying in the trenches when his company retired.
"I got that in fair fighting," said Ben, pointing
to his wounded arm. He told me the rest of the
story briefly, and did not care to refer to it again.
"When the Germans came along they shouted
'Hands up.' I was lying in the bottom of the
trench. I lifted my left hand, but a German
soldier, jumping over the trench, fired down at
me point-blank, and the bullet, which went
through my right thigh, knocked me unconscious."
Ben was sent back to England a few months later,
and will probably be crippled for life.</p>

<p>On December 5th a party of convalescent British
soldiers arrived from the Civil Hospital, among
them R.&nbsp;Anderson, a reservist from my own battalion,
L.-Cpl. M'Donald, Royal Irish, and James
Prime, Rifle Brigade.</p>

<p>I can never forget the four days these men spent
with me at the 106&mdash;first, because they were such
good companions, and second, because two of these
men subsequently met death at German hands
under circumstances of revolting inhumanity.</p>

</div>

<p>Prime represented all that is best in the typical
English soldier. He came from the Midlands, the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_167" title="167"> </a>
heart of England. It was a treat for me to sit and
listen to the story of his short battle experience,
which, a plain and common tale in these times,
acquired enthralling interest from the graphic
language and quiet humour of the speaker.</p>

<p>Irish, Scotch, and English, we all gathered in
the Salle cinq and forgot our troubles, present and
impending.</p>

<p>Prime was a born story-teller. He possessed
the rare faculty of making pictures in the minds
of his hearers. He showed me a photograph of
his wife and children, and I can well remember the
description of his home in England. We found
a subject of mutual interest in the keeping of
poultry on the "intensive" system, and discussed
the respective merits of Wyandottes, Leghorns,
and Buff Orpingtons.</p>

<p>"Bob" Anderson, when I first saw him, was
sitting dressed in blue coat and red kepi at the
refectory table with Prime, M'Donald the Irish
Lance-Corporal, and half a dozen French soldiers.
Right glad I was to hear the familiar accents of
my native land!</p>

<p>Anderson could give me no news of the battalion,
as he had been knocked out at the same time and
place as myself. On the whole, the Germans had
so far treated him fairly well. "It was surely the
whole German army," said Bob, "that marched
along the road near Audencourt when I was lying
<a class="pagenum" name="page_168" title="168"> </a>
in the ditch with a broken leg, smoking my pipe.
They didn't take much notice. At one of the halts
a German stepped out of the ranks&mdash;'Hullo, Jock,
what's ado wi' you?' said he, and gave me a drink
out of his water-bottle. This was a German who
had lived for fifteen years in Glasgow! The next
halt was a different story. Several of the Germans
gathered round, shook their fists at me, and one of
them snatched the pipe out of my mouth and threw
it away."</p>

<p>M'Donald, who soon after died a hero's death
at Wittenberg, was a young fellow not more than
twenty-one or twenty-two, quiet, sad, and delicate-looking.
He had quite recovered from a dangerous
wound in the chest, though he was still weak and
walked with difficulty.</p>

<p>A photographer came and took a group of the
British soldiers, who were mostly dressed in French
uniform, and next day they were all taken off to
Germany. Their departure for Germany was such
a day of sadness for us who were left behind, that
it seems as if we must have had some premonition
of the future. The men went off loaded with as
many parcels as they could carry&mdash;shirts, socks,
tobacco, food, a bottle of wine in each greatcoat
pocket, and five francs each from the Hospital
Funds.</p>

<p>Of the three soldiers, Anderson is the only one
who has lived to tell the story of what befell after
<a class="pagenum" name="page_169" title="169"> </a>
leaving the courtyard of the 106 on Dec.&nbsp;7, 1914.
Anderson survived, was eventually exchanged, and
we met a year later in Millbank Hospital. The
following is the story in his own words, taken down
in shorthand. It is a story which bears the stamp
of truth in every word, and is corroborated in every
detail by a Government report published in all the
daily papers on April 10, 1916:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we left Cambrai Station, we were sent
in a hospital train to Giessen; it took us three
days. We had one basin of soup each day, and
a piece of bread.</p>

<p>"When we got to Giessen we were taken to a
waiting-room at the station and bad used. All the
English were put on one side, called 'English
swine' and that kind of thing. We were then
taken in a motor ambulance to the Town Hall in
Giessen. We were three weeks in that hospital
and the food was all right there, but we, especially
the English, were bad used all the time by the
orderlies. There were four English altogether&mdash;M'Donald,
Prime, and myself, and another chap in
the Wilts. We went from there to Giessen camp, a
great big French camp, and had to march two and
a half miles with two sticks; I was nearly dead
when I reached that camp; it was all uphill, and
a crowd behind us shoving us on. We were there
three days, then had orders to fall in and march to
the station again. We started to march to the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_170" title="170"> </a>
station, but I was not fit to do it, and some one
stopped me in the town, put me on a car, and took
me to the station in the car. We got to Wittenberg
the next day, and as soon as we arrived in
Wittenberg all the people were at the station, a
big crowd, men and women. They all had big
sticks, some had bars of iron, and we had to run
the gauntlet of this,&mdash;of course I could not do so.
I got one terrible kick, but anyhow I managed to
get into camp, and as soon as we got into camp
we got knocked about by the Germans, and everything
was taken from us.</p>

<p>"Of course the food was horrible all the time.
We had heard stories about typhus in the camp,
and the French doctors inoculated us. I took ill
about the beginning of February, and the Frenchman
took my temperature, which was very high.
He ordered me to the hospital, but there were no
stretchers to be got. Six men carried me down to
the bottom of the camp, about half a mile, and
dragged me into an empty bungalow. It was in
the same camp; there was no isolation. I was put
on the floor amongst a lot of Russians; there were
very few beds, and I was on the bare floor. In the
camp there was one bed between three men, and I
had left my bed in the camp. I lay on the bare
floor all the afternoon; no orderlies were there;
nobody came near me. The soup came up at
night&mdash;just the same ordinary rations as we got in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_171" title="171"> </a>
camp. The soup came up in a wooden tub without
a cover, and they had to carry it about half a mile
from the cook-house, and it arrived at the hospital
full of dust and dirt&mdash;at the door of the hospital.
The strongest that were able to get it got it, and
the weakest lay without. That is a fact. I lay
there about three or four days, when some
Englishmen volunteered to come down and look
after us.</p>

<p>"I took typhus first: when I was in hospital
four or five days, Prime was carried there; he was
put down on the floor, and died four or five days
afterwards. Sergeant Spence of the Scots Guards
was with him when he died. Just before the end
they got him a ramshackle bed made up with
boards, no mattress.</p>

<p>"The place was a long, narrow hut, whitewashed
all over, and about one hundred men in it, absolutely
packed, and not more than half a dozen beds
at the first. We lay on the floor. There were
stoves, but hardly any coal. No one brought in
any food. You had to go outside to get it, and
the orderly would give you some soup in your basin
if you were there. Those not fit to rise from the
floor got none unless a comrade brought it to
them.</p>

<p>"The French doctors came round, but what
could they do? They had nothing to give you, and
could do absolutely nothing.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_172" title="172"> </a></p>

<p>"The Germans had all left the camp as soon as
typhus broke out. They built up wooden shoots to
put the food down. When parcels from home came
they went down the shoot.</p>

<p>"When the beds came in carts they were lifted
over the barbed wire. No Germans came in.</p>

<p>"There were never enough beds, and men were
lying on the floor all the time.</p>

<p>"We had nearly 100 deaths a day at one time.
The total population of the camp was about
16-17,000, with only about six doctors, French
and Russian. Then we had six British R.A.M.C.
doctors&mdash;Captain Sutcliffe, Major Fry, Captain
Fielding, Captain Vidal, and Mr Lugard. Major
Fry, Captain Fielding, and Captain Sutcliffe took
the typhus and died. I never got a wash all the
time I was there until I was able to go to the tap.
There was one fellow, a private in the Gordons,
who never had his wound dressed; it was running
all the time. He died of pure neglect and typhus.
A man died next me with his clothes on, never had
them off, even his greatcoat on. Our clothes were
running with vermin&mdash;millions!</p>

<p>"You could not get dressings or bandages. I
have seen men with open wounds who have had to
wash their bandages, and hang them up to dry
before they could put them on again.</p>

<p>"M'Donald volunteered as an orderly in the
Typhus Ward, and when he came along he was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_173" title="173"> </a>
only one day on duty when he took typhus. He got
better, but declined because of the starvation diet.
I had him out walking for a little bit up and down,
but he was very weak, a living skeleton. He would
fall down, and I told him to try and get up and
walk a little bit. 'Oh, Jock,' he says, 'I'm no' fit.'
'Come on,' I said, 'try.' He got a parcel from
home&mdash;one from his mother&mdash;just before he died.
It was just from hunger and neglect.</p>

<p>"Things were getting that bad about the month
of April that the Germans began to get a little
afraid, and started a new hospital&mdash;about half a
dozen of huts. It was isolated from the camp, and
we moved there about the beginning of May.</p>

<p>"Things gradually got a little better after that,
but January, February, and March were three
awful months.</p>

<p>"The Germans did not come back into the camp
till the month of August.</p>

<p>"After I was better of the typhus I was back in
the same camp. All food was thrown over the
barbed wire. Even packets were sent down the
shoot. The Germans never came near; you would
see them outside the wire. Just before the American
Ambassador came there was a new thing for
carrying down the food&mdash;something like a dustbin
with a lid on. The shoot is still there, but is not
used. After the Ambassador came we put in a
claim, saying we had been passed as unfit for
<a class="pagenum" name="page_174" title="174"> </a>
military service, and men who ought to have gone
home last August had had it cancelled at the last
moment; but we heard no more. The American
Ambassador said that must be the Government's
fault; he would see about it. He sent us a lot of
games. We were only allowed to play games
between the huts.</p>

<p>"The camp was run by the Russians, and nobody
to look after us. The Germans never came in; you
could do what you liked as long as you did not go
too near the wire, when they used to sound the
alarm. When the alarm sounded at night we had
to run into the park, and if you did not get into
the park soon enough they fired at you. They
fired one night and killed six Frenchmen. One
of the Royal Irish who came up with me had
a bullet right past his ear,&mdash;I suppose it made
him pretty nippy.</p>

<p>"We got no clean clothing or a change. The
English were all in rags: you would not know
they were soldiers at all to look at them. Just
three days before the American Ambassador came,
when they heard he was coming, they paraded us
all up and looked at our underclothing. We got
a shirt and a pair of socks to smarten us up. You
could never get hot water; but the day that the
American Ambassador came the Germans came
round in the morning and told us that if any
of us wanted hot water, to send two men out
<a class="pagenum" name="page_175" title="175"> </a>
of each room to the cook-house and get as much
boiling water as we wanted. We wondered what
was up: we were saying there was something up
that day. The Ambassador asked us what clothing
we had. He made a great improvement: we
got shirts and overcoats, but they took all our
overcoats away.</p>

<p>"He asked a lot of men if they had had typhus;
he seemed to know all about it. Just previous to
that, a Mr Jackson from the American Embassy
came. It is wonderful how things got about the
camp. This was shortly after the typhus was
cleared out, but he did not come into the camp.
There were about thirty yards of space between
the wires, and he could not speak to any of us;
he just went round. There was a crowd of Germans;
but when Mr Gerard came himself he
came into the barrack-room and asked one man
a question, then another.</p>

<p>"There was a German who could speak English,
but he never came near them. Mr Gerard
seemed to go about the thing very business-like:
he was not afraid. He was very keen on getting
hold of any man who had been out working and
had come in again to camp. Some had not been
paid. They were only paid 30 pfennigs (3d.) a day
for a hard day's work. The camp was working at
a big factory, and you had to get up at 4 in the
morning, and they drove you into a big square
<a class="pagenum" name="page_176" title="176"> </a>
like a sheep-pen and put all the English together.
We called it the Slave Market. They drove you
into this pen, and the gangers would come in the
morning and take you out. 'I will have you,' and
'You come along with me,'&mdash;just like a slave
market. We had to get up at 4 and went out
at 5. You were put in the slave market at 5.30,
and worked from then till 6 at night&mdash;and very
hard work too. We were working on building
a big factory where they were making hand-grenades&mdash;very
intricate machinery. Nobody
seemed quite to know what they were manufacturing
there. The men were carrying the stone
for the building. One German who could speak
English told one of my chums that the factory
was for making hand-grenades.</p>

<p>"They gave out an order that there was to be
no smoking in the barrack-room, as the French
had refused to allow German prisoners in France
to smoke, so they would stop it there. If they
caught a man smoking, and they had a stick,
he got it. There were no orders printed to tell
us what we had or had not to do. They never
deliberately tied an Englishman to a post, but I
have seen them doing it to Russians, tying
them up to the post. If you did anything that
did not please them, you were put in the coal-hole,
we used to call it, the place where they get
the coal-briquettes from, and kept without food
<a class="pagenum" name="page_177" title="177"> </a>
for three days&mdash;only bread and water, solitary
confinement. Many an Englishman got that.
We used to carry down some of our dinner and
slip it into them.</p>

<p>"The day the American Ambassador came,
Captain Vidal looked well after it, and anything
that was done he reported it at once. I think
he had been saying something to the American
Ambassador, and one of the Germans had overheard
it. When the Ambassador went away, he
struck Captain Vidal with his sword. We heard
that was the reason why Captain Vidal did not
come with us, as there was an inquiry about it
at the time. Then Major Priestly was in solitary
confinement for a while&mdash;I don't know what he
had done; we heard that he was found with a
revolver, but we could not say. He was isolated
away from the officers altogether for close on two
months&mdash;never saw him. He is back again in
camp now. We read in the 'Continental Times'
that he was going home on the 3rd September&mdash;or
August&mdash;but some proceedings were being
taken against him. It said in the 'Continental
Times' misbehaviour,&mdash;I suppose in looking well
after the wounded&mdash;or something like that.</p>

<p>"One day we had to pass the German doctor
and then went back to barracks. Heard no more
until six days afterwards, and the 1st December
a German came up about 8&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span> and formed us
<a class="pagenum" name="page_178" title="178"> </a>
up in the barrack-room. Some of those going
home had a new shirt given them. A Russian
was stopped and told to take off his clogs and
give them to that Englishman. Then we went
to Aachen. A complaint had been sent to Wittenberg
about us; they were kicking up a terrible
row for sending us away like that. The officer
commanding the camp asked us where we came
from. When we said Wittenberg, he said he
thought so. We looked such awful sights&mdash;filthy;
and we were supposed to be dressed coming away.
We were very well treated at Aachen&mdash;they always
do so. Every one was nicer than another, to try and
create a good impression. We knew what it was.</p>

<p>"I was sorry for two chaps. One of the
London Scottish had been there fourteen months,
and had a bad wound in his leg, and could not
move his leg. He was sent back because he was a
non-commissioned officer. Another man, a sergeant,
with his leg off, could speak Hindustani, and
I think that was the reason he was sent back, but
I am not sure. His leg was off to the thigh. He
was with the Lugard party. A lance-corporal,
with his arm off, was also sent back, after thinking
he was going to be exchanged. None of the non-commissioned
officers got away from that place."</p>

<hr />

<p>There is a corner of the hospital courtyard where
in December the rays of the sun will fall for the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_179" title="179"> </a>
space of an hour, illuminating first the big high
wall which shuts off light and air from the north-west,
then throwing upon the ground itself a
triangle of light which gradually broadens, loses
shape, and fills at last the narrow passage between
the courtyard and the dead garden, but stops short
of the broken wooden paling, throwing no cleansing
ray on the dismal rubbish-heaps, leaving undisturbed
the sepulchral clamminess of the shadows
beyond.</p>

<p>In days of peace this corner was surely favoured
by the school children. From the high wall to the
gable of the main building stretches a single heavy
beam, which had perhaps once been painted green,
but was now green with the mould of decay. A
few rusty rings and hooks, from one of which a
piece of sodden rope still hung, showed to what
purpose the beam had served.</p>

<p>The rain, which had been falling steadily, as it
seemed, day and night during November, was
checked by the first threat of frost, and during the
fortnight before Christmas we had bright and
cheerful weather. A few convalescent patients
were tempted to take a seat in the sun, and came
to notice the hour, early in the afternoon, when
the triangle of light first strikes the high wall.</p>

<p>We had a bench placed against the wall (it was
a very tiny one, and belonged to one of the junior
classrooms). Picard, myself, and two French
<a class="pagenum" name="page_180" title="180"> </a>
soldiers from Salle un were at first the only <i>habitués</i>;
none of the British soldiers remaining at the 106
were able to leave their beds, and most of the other
Frenchmen were either too weak or too frightened
of fresh air to come out and sit in the yard.</p>

<p>It is a common failing of human nature to feel
comforted at the sight of other people's misfortune.
So it was that the sight of a French soldier who
had been shot in the head aroused in me not only
the interest of pity, but also, I must confess, a
sense of superiority at finding some one worse off
than myself. Jean was the name we called him by.
No one knew his real name or his regiment, or the
place where he was born, or any details of how he
had been wounded. His wound in the head was
on the left side, almost exactly in the same place
as my own&mdash;the bullet had made the same furrow,
all the symptoms were identical, the right leg dragging,
the right arm hanging, the slow elephantine
movement; but there was a difference, said Dr
Debu, between the two points of impact. In the
case of Jean the impact of the bullet was a hair's-breadth
more to the front of the head, only the
difference of perhaps a tenth of a millimetre. And
so it was that poor Jean had lost not only the
power of motion on the right side, but also speech,
memory, and understanding.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p180i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">
  A Ward at the "106."</p>
</div>

<p>All these faculties might return in time (doctors
are optimists <i>par métier</i>), but at present understanding
<a class="pagenum" name="page_181" title="181"> </a>
was limited to questions of the most primitive
order&mdash;cold and heat, hunger and thirst; speech to
a moan which signified no; memory to events of
the past forty-eight hours, so that Jean knew
nothing of the war, of his regiment, of his home;
his face with his dropped jaw and vacant look was
already the face of an idiot.</p>

<p>One morning in the refectory Jean fell off his
chair on to the floor, grew purple in the face and
foamed at the mouth. Urgent messengers flew off
to fetch Dr Debu, and we all thought it was the end
of Jean, until my nurse of the Salle cinq suggested
epileptic fits, an opinion which was subsequently
ratified by the doctor's verdict, "epilepsie Jacksonienne."
Jean did not appear again in the yard
until nearly a fortnight after this incident, and his
place on the bench in the sun was taken by another
whose name, according to his own statement, was
"Mahamed, son of Mahamed."</p>

<p>Mahamed was still limping badly from a shot
wound in the calf. He did not look more than
nineteen, and came from near Oran. His knowledge
of French was confined to "Merci le Madam,"
with a shining smile, and "Alleman grand
cochon."</p>

<p>Mahamed, having discovered my knowledge of a
few words of his native tongue and my acquaintance
with his native country, followed me about
like a shadow. For many months his feelings had
<a class="pagenum" name="page_182" title="182"> </a>
perforce been suppressed, and now presuming too
greatly on my supposed fluency in Arabic conversation,
the poor fellow sat on the little bench in the
sun pouring out his story.</p>

<p>We had the story nearly every day, and I began
to put bits of it together. Of one thing he was
quite certain, namely, that the "Alleman" was a
pig and son of a pig, and that his other ancestors
were of most infamous repute. In the mixed lingo
of the bench, the same declaration was made every
day at the close of the sitting, when the sun went
behind the high wall: "Alleman no bon, kif kif
cochon Yhoudi ben Yhoudi, Sheitan ben Sheitan,
Halouf ben Halouf."</p>

<p>"Ça c'est tout de même vrai," said Picard the
one-legged, patting his stump thoughtfully and
pulling volcanoes of smoke from his clay pipe.
"Alleman kif kif cochon." "Le Boche voyez
vous," said Picard, addressing the bench party,
which was slowly moving back to hospital, "le
Boche ça a des petits yeux de cochon, c'est blanc
et rose, comme le cochon, ça mange.... Ah, les
Boches Halouf ben Halouf," and Picard hurriedly
finished his discourse out of respect for M.&nbsp;le
Vicaire-General, who had just joined the group.</p>

<p>"Bonjour, M.&nbsp;le Vicaire, you're just in time,"
I said. "Nous disions du mal de notre prochain."
"Il n'y a pas de mal à ça, Monsieur le Curé,"
interrupted Picard, "puisque nous ne parlions
<a class="pagenum" name="page_183" title="183"> </a>
que des Boches." "Voyons, M.&nbsp;le Curé," this
aggressively, "the Gospel tells us to love our
enemies. Do you love the Boches?" This
question, and the spirit in which it was asked,
was significant of the new atmosphere which had
begun to permeate the Salle cinq after the arrival
of the French soldier who had declared himself
an enemy of fresh air. Gradually this man's
evil influence pervaded the whole ward, just as
the evil thing he stood for had permeated all
France before the war.</p>

<p>M.&nbsp;le Vicaire-General came to the Salle cinq
nearly every day, visiting each man's bedside, and
no man, except one, however unspiritual his past,
could resist the charm of the old priest, in whose
smile shone an unselfish soul.</p>

<p>The "enemy of fresh air" was known to the
British soldiers in the ward as "Judas Iscariot."
When the priest came near his bed, Judas shook
his head slightly and smiled an almost imperceptible
smile, with all the air of saying, "La
religion c'est pour les enfants, les femmes et les
imbéciles."</p>

<p>It was some sneer from Judas that prompted
Picard's question.</p>

<p>"Voyons, M.&nbsp;le Curé, aimez vouz les
Boches?"</p>

<p>The old priest looked at Picard's honest troubled
face and answered slowly&mdash;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_184" title="184"> </a>
"Mais puisque l'évangile nous ordonne de nous

ennemis, il faut toujours faire son possible pour
suivre ce divin conseil et je peux dire que j'aime

<p>In Germany, just as in England, Christmas is
kept with great feasting and rejoicing, and during
the week preceding Christmas M.&nbsp;Vampouille was
hard at work making sausages for his German
customers, who were to hold a festive meeting at
the Kommandantur. Great preparations were also
being made at the 106, and the staff of the hospital,
forgetting for the time being their private
squabbles, joined with our friends in the town
in preparing a Merry Christmas.</p>

<p>Christmas morning. Mass at 10 o'clock in Salle
un. M.&nbsp;le Vicaire-General preaches a tactful
sermon on "resignation." After Mass candles on
the Christmas tree are lit and presents distributed.</p>

<p>The altar was erected at the extreme end of
Salle un, and very artistically decorated with
palms, laurel branches, and holly; behind the altar
were two large flags (home-made) of England and
France; on the right was a large Christmas tree.</p>

</div>

<p>All patients who were fit to be moved, except
Judas Iscariot, were carried up from the Salle
cinq and grouped near the altar. In the bed
nearest the altar a British reservist lay with a
shattered spine, still alive, still conscious, still
<a class="pagenum" name="page_185" title="185"> </a>
able to speak, the lower half of his body lifeless
since the 26th of August 1914. This was his last
week on earth. "Here's a funny kind of Christmas,"
he whispered; "next Christmas we'll be
at home, shan't we?"</p>

<p>On my right, close to the altar steps, sat Picard,
beyond him Mahamed ben Mahamed looking
puzzled and depressed, and at the end of the
row a lady on crutches, dressed in deep mourning,
who had lost a leg during the aeroplane fight
in September. The other wounded were seated
in beds, packed in double row, half-way down
each side of the ward, the remainder of which
was filled with friends from the town.</p>

<p>Madame Tondeur was busy in the kitchen with
three turkeys to roast and carve into very small
pieces, so that every one might get a taste. The plum
pudding being very small, was reserved for the Salle
cinq. Printed directions on the tin suggested that
the pudding could be eaten cold or boiled for "half
an hour." Perhaps this was a misprint for "half a
day." After the half-hour's boiling, the pudding
still seemed to have a compressed appearance, and
looked very diminutive under its large stick of
holly. Madame Tondeur herself carried the flaming
pudding into the Salle cinq, divided it up into
twelve portions, the indigestible but fortunately
small fragments were duly eaten, and the ancient
tradition of Christmas remained for us unbroken.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_186" title="186"> </a>
Between Christmas and the New Year it was
decided that my name was to go down on the
list of "transportables," and that I would have
to join the next party for Germany. Thinking
over the last few days spent at the 106 Hospital,
I remember first of all the parting words of my
nurse: "In days to come try and remember the
bright side of your stay here and forget the days
of darkness." And here I may say in plain words
what I feel most deeply, although these words
cannot be read for many months, perhaps years,
by those to whom I would wish to address them.</p>

<p>Many a limbless British soldier owes his life to
the surgeon of the Civil Hospital. The question
in those days was not merely "Will an operation
save life?" but rather, "Is there time to operate
on those whose lives might be saved?" Dr Debu
proved himself to be the man for such an emergency.
United to great skill, he possessed great physical
strength and powers of resistance to fatigue. For
three days and three nights he operated almost
without taking time for meals or sleep.</p>

<p>For the devoted kindness of the French doctors
and nurses, both of the Hôpital Civil, the 106, and
the other ten or twelve hospitals of Cambrai, who
for many months under conditions of great difficulty
and danger, without many of the most
necessary medical appliances, worked night and
day to save the lives of British soldiers and to
ease the last moments of the mortally wounded,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_187" title="187"> </a>
I feel that this very inadequate expression of
gratitude must be set down.</p>

<p>There are many other kind friends at Cambrai
whose kindness I can never forget.</p>

<p>Consider my situation at Cambrai: unknown,
cut off from all intercourse with the world, about
to start off for a German prison, and without a
sixpence. I did not like to ask a loan from my
kind friends, who had already given me a complete
outfit of underclothing and toilet necessaries. On
New Year's Day the subject of money was broached
by M.&nbsp;Rey in a straightforward business-like manner.
"You are shortly going to Germany," he said;
"even in prison money is useful; you will need
some money; we have brought you some." The
sum M.&nbsp;Rey proposed to give me was £50! We
decided that half this sum would be ample, and
I gave M.&nbsp;Rey a receipt "payable après la
guerre."</p>

<p>After these true friends in need had left, M.&nbsp;Vampouille
came in to sit with me, and he made the
same suggestion about money, and insisted on my
accepting a further sum, the loan of which, he said,
is granted on one condition only: "You must not
pay me by cheque, you must come yourself&mdash;after
the war!"</p>

<p>Next morning a decrepit omnibus driven by a
German soldier came to take me from the Hôpital
106 to M.&nbsp;Brunot's Hôpital Annexe, from where,
after three days, I was sent off to Germany.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_188" title="188"> </a>
CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="small">CAMBRAI TO WÜRZBURG.</span></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>I had been four months in hospital when my
name was put down on the list of "transportables,"
and a place was reserved for me in the
"Zug Lazaret."</p>

<p>These trains were made up according to the
output from the different hospitals along the
front, chiefly from Lille, Douai, Cambrai, and
St&nbsp;Quentin.</p>

<p>After the pressure of traffic consequent on the
rush back from the Marne had subsided, a regular
hospital-train service was inaugurated, and trains
direct to Munich were run once a week.</p>

<p>When I expressed some fears to Dr Schmidt as
to how I would be treated on my journey, he
laughed, saying something about German culture,
and that one must not believe all the tales one
hears about the Germans. At any rate, he assured
<a class="pagenum" name="page_189" title="189"> </a>
me I had nothing to fear, for instructions
had been given to pay every attention that the
nature of my wound required, and I was to travel
by a special Lazaret with a comfortable bed and
plenty of good food from a restaurant car.</p>

<p>In the light of subsequent experiences I am
sometimes rather suspicious of my friend's kindly
intentions. The German idea of humour is so
different from any other. I often wonder if Dr
Schmidt had been "pulling my leg" in his clumsy
German way.</p>

<p>However, when the motor ambulance came to
fetch me at 10&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span> on the 6th of January, I
started off on my journey quite free in my mind
from painful anticipations. I pictured to myself
a comfortable hospital train, with perhaps a German
Schwester to look after the worst cases, and
if not a made-up bed, at least a stretcher on which
I could rest my paralysed limbs.</p>

<p>On arriving at Cambrai station I found that the
"special hospital train" consisted of ordinary 3rd-class
corridor coaches, which were packed with
French and English wounded. I was helped along
the train by two kindly German soldiers, and lifted
up into a 2nd-class carriage, where I was warmly
greeted by a French Army doctor, like myself <i>en
route</i> for a German prison.</p>

<p>One side of the carriage had been made up as a
bed, and the nice white sheets looked most inviting.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_190" title="190"> </a>
However, my satisfaction with what I supposed to
be the arrangements for my comfort was short-lived.
I had scarcely time for more than a few words with
the French doctor when a German officer, a lieutenant,
appeared at the door. His message was
brief and easy to understand. I was to get out.</p>

<p>In spite of my protests, this officer attempted
to make me climb down on to the platform, but
as this was quite beyond my powers, he allowed
me to crawl along the corridor. At the far end of
the train was a 3rd-class corridor coach of the
usual Continental type, with hard wooden seats,
the partitions running only half-way to the roof.
This coach was full of wounded French and English
soldiers, among whom I recognised several
who had been in hospital with me, but I was not
allowed to speak to them. At the end of the coach
was a compartment, one side of which had been
transformed into a bed by nailing up a board
against the seat, which was covered with straw.</p>

<p>I was assisted on to my bed of straw by a German
N.C.O., who, along with three other soldiers,
all with loaded rifles and fixed bayonets, took up all
the remaining room in the carriage. It was evident
that I was to be efficiently guarded.</p>

<p>I took no notice of my escort, but kept an eye
on the platform, as I wished to get a hold of some
German officer of high rank, in order to protest
against my removal from the 2nd-class carriage.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_191" title="191"> </a>
Presently an inspecting officer, a captain, I think,
came along the train.</p>

<p>I explained to this officer that the wound in
my head was only newly healed, that I was still
quite paralysed on one side, and that Dr Schmidt
had arranged (as I thought) for my proper accommodation
on the journey.</p>

<p>I requested permission to be allowed to travel
along with the French officer from whose company
I had been somewhat rudely shifted.</p>

<p>The German officer, standing on the platform,
listened to what I had to say, and when I had
finished he got on to the footboard, looked through
my carriage window at the wooden bed, the straw,
and the three sentries, and then I got my answer:
"Das ist schön für einen Engländer."</p>

<p>This was my first lesson in German Kultur. I
thanked the contemptuous German most heartily,
and I fancy that my exaggerated politeness somewhat
annoyed him.</p>

<p>Although I did not appear to be taking any
notice of my sentries, I could not avoid catching
the eye of the man opposite, who kept on glaring
at me with a most objectionable persistency.</p>

<p>I looked at him in my most benevolent manner,
but made no attempt at conversation.</p>

<p>When presently the others got up and went out
into the corridor, this man's conduct became most
alarming. He was evidently under stress of some
<a class="pagenum" name="page_192" title="192"> </a>
strong emotion. Suddenly his whole manner
changed. Laying a finger on his lips with a warning
gesture, he bent towards me and said in a low
tense voice, "Moi aussi je hais les Allemands."</p>

<p>In spite of the hatred in his voice and the
bitter look which accompanied the words, I did
not show much eagerness to follow up this somewhat
startling opening for conversation. I was
rather afraid of some trap. One had heard stories
of prisoners on the way to Germany being taken
out of the train and shot on the accusation of
having spoken of the Fatherland in an unbecoming
manner or on some similar trumped-up charge.
All attempt at further conversation was, however,
put a stop to by the return of the other sentries.</p>

<p>The soldier opposite, whether friend or foe I
knew not, remained silent and motionless in his
corner, although from time to time he favoured me
with a malevolent stare, while his companions took
hardly any notice of me at all. It was some time
before another opportunity occurred for private
conversation. However, at some country station
the three soldiers got out to get a drink of coffee,
leaving me alone with the mysterious sentry. Again
his manner changed, and again bending forward,
he hissed with a hatred in his voice that seemed
very genuine, "Moi aussi je hais les Allemands."</p>

<p>And then in atrociously bad French my
"friendly" enemy threw light on his mysterious
<a class="pagenum" name="page_193" title="193"> </a>
behaviour by explaining that he was a Pole, and
was under orders to join at Valenciennes some
reinforcements that were being hurried up to
Arras. "I have to go on," he said; "I cannot
help myself, but I will never aim straight at the
French or English."</p>

<p>I suggested that he might perhaps manage to
get taken prisoner, but he answered that it would
be most difficult, as all Poles were kept separate
from their fellow-countrymen and closely watched.</p>

<p>Any shirking in the firing line would mean instant
death at the hand of some Bavarian comrade.</p>

<p>He begged me not to betray by any word or
sign that we had conversed together, because he
was looked upon with suspicion by the other
soldiers, and for that reason had feigned intense
hatred of the English. This was the explanation
of the malevolent stare at me. At this point the
other sentries returned, and no further opportunity
for conversation occurred.</p>

<p>My newly-found friend was evidently worrying
over his miserable lot. He took out a well-thumbed
Feldpostkarte, and as he read one could
see that his thoughts were far away with the
wife and children from whose side he had been
dragged to fight for the hereditary enemies of his
country. I shall not easily forget the sadness of
the man's face,&mdash;a young face with very dark,
dog-like eyes. There was nothing smart about
<a class="pagenum" name="page_194" title="194"> </a>
him; he was indeed rather more dirty than even
a travel-stained soldier from Poland had any right
to be. As I looked at him I thought of the countless
numbers of German soldiers whose lives had
been sacrificed in vain efforts to capture the French
position at Arras. And this man was to be one
more. His fate was perhaps the hardest of all.
For him there would not even be the soldier's
last consolation of duty done. As the train drew
up at Valenciennes the soldiers in my carriage
began to put on their equipment, and when the
train had stopped they all got out. My Polish
friend went out last, and as he left the carriage
he turned round and bade me with his eyes a
silent and almost appealing farewell.</p>

<p>Valenciennes is an important junction, forming
a central point from which the railway line
branches off to both the French and the English
front. Moreover, the principal base hospital had
been transferred here from Cambrai early in
October, so I was not surprised to find the platform
crowded with Red Cross attendants, stretcher-bearers,
doctors, railway transport officers, and
soldiers representing all parts of the German
Empire. Now that my Polish friend and his two
comrades had gone I was left alone with the fat
<i>unterofficier</i>, who took the first opportunity that
was offered of exercising his authority over me.</p>

<p>It was a very mild evening for January, and as
<a class="pagenum" name="page_195" title="195"> </a>
I soon got tired of watching the crowd of German
soldiery, whose presence in France is an outrage
that cannot be fully realised by merely reading
about it in the papers, I leant out of the window
on the opposite side of the train. The contrast
was striking. Not a soldier was in sight, and the
little French town, as far as one could see from
my carriage window, seemed abnormally quiet.
To make complete the illusions of peace, a grey-headed
French railway employee in his blue blouse
came sauntering down the line.</p>

<p>When he reached my carriage and saw the British
uniform, he cordially wished me good-evening,
and asked where I had been wounded. I did not
get further in the conversation than to return the
"bonsoir" when my sentry rushed across the
carriage, threw up the window, and in a voice
meant to be most terrifying thundered out that
"to speak out of the window was 'verboten.'"</p>

<p>I said I was sorry, but did not know it to be
"verboten." This inoffensive remark produced a
regular parade scolding, accompanied by an interesting
exhibition of eye-rolling, which forms an
important part of German military discipline.</p>

<p>The lecture ended up with a dramatic pointing
of the finger to an enormous high-up stomach and
"Ich verbiete." I said "All right."</p>

<p>This seemed about to cause another storm, so I
hurriedly translated it into "Ist gut."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_196" title="196"> </a>
My guardian, still rumbling, went out into the
corridor; I opened the window again, and the train
moved slowly out of the station.</p>

<p>The train did not stop again till we were well
over the Belgian frontier.</p>

<p>I did not see any frontier marks, nor did we stop
at any frontier stations. A rough calculation, however,
of the distance we had gone from Valenciennes
showed that we must have reached Belgium
about 6&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span> As the train was now going very
slowly, I was able to observe the countryside with
more attention, and I was eagerly looking out for
some landmark that might enable me to recognise
the road along which we had marched
on our way up to Mons nearly five months
before.</p>

<p>Our first stop in Belgium was at a small country
station, the name of which I have forgotten. This
place must have been just on the fringe of the
fighting during the last week of August. It was
here that began the trail of the Hun.</p>

<p>The station was a complete wreck, and in the
adjoining village only one house seemed to have
escaped destruction. Temporary shelters had been
rigged up with corrugated iron all along the platform,
at the end of which was a wooden Red Cross
dressing-station.</p>

<p>These dressing-stations have been set up at every
station, however small, all along the line between
<a class="pagenum" name="page_197" title="197"> </a>
the German frontier and the front, and form a
striking example of German organisation and efficiency.
They consist of two small rooms, one of
which can be used as an operating-room, and is
stocked with first-aid appliances and a small pharmacy.
The whole building can be taken down and
set up elsewhere in a very short time.</p>

<p>The country now presented a melancholy sight,
and as the railway line itself had been much damaged,
the speed of the train was reduced to a
crawl over the numerous temporary wooden railway
bridges.</p>

<p>In Belgium the railway line was always strongly
guarded, while in France I hardly noticed any
troops except at the railway stations. From the
moment we entered Belgium it was evident that
a great number of soldiers were billeted in the
villages and towns, or rather in the huts that had
been constructed amidst the ruins. In fact, the
German soldiers seemed in this district to have
taken the place of the Belgian population, as between
the frontier and Mons I do not remember
seeing a single Belgian. Of course, at this time
I did not know that thousands of Belgians had
fled to England, nor had I heard anything more
than vague rumours of German atrocities, such as
the burning of Louvain and the indiscriminate
murder of the civilian population in many parts
of Belgium. I was therefore somewhat at a loss
<a class="pagenum" name="page_198" title="198"> </a>
to understand why the railway line was so very
much more carefully guarded in Belgium than it
was in France, and why the civilian population
seemed to have almost disappeared.</p>

<p>As we began to enter the mining district in
which the town of Mons is situated, I looked out
of my prison window with renewed interest at the
more dominant features of the landscape, which I
could now recognise quite distinctly.</p>

<p>At one place the line followed for a short time
the very road along which we had marched on the
22nd August, the day before the battle of Mons,
happy in our ignorance of all that was to
come.</p>

<p>It was along this same straight road lined with
tall poplar trees that the grey-clad German soldiers
had been rushed on in motor-cars, that the hundreds
of machine-guns and light artillery had
hurried with the hope, that was so nearly realised
at Le Cateau, of destroying what was left of the
little British army. Further on the line skirts the
now famous Canal de Condé.</p>

<p>The effect of the German shell fire was very
noticeable along the banks of the canal. Most of
the houses within a hundred yards of the water
had been totally destroyed, so that the ground
between the railway line and the canal was now
fairly open. On the right side of the line the
damage had not been so considerable; still, even
<a class="pagenum" name="page_199" title="199"> </a>
on that side fully fifty per cent of the houses were
roofless. As far as a limited view from the railway
would allow me to judge, I do not think the upper
part of the town was much knocked about. Most
of the German shelling on the 23rd had been
directed on the British positions along the canal,
and any damage that was done in the town itself
was probably caused by the British guns' attempt
to check the German advance through the town
later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The lower part of the town of Mons reminded
me of the streets of Pompeii. The silent ruins
had been abandoned even by the German soldiers.
Here and there some rough attempt had been
made to provide shelter, and we passed a few
miserable women and children who were standing
grouped in the doorways of their shattered homes.
We entered the station of Mons at about 7&nbsp;<span class="small">P.M.</span>
Here, as far as could be seen, everything seemed
quite normal, and no traces were visible of the
storm that must have raged all around during that
eventful August day when British troops had paid
their flying visit to the town.</p>

<p>The platform side of the train was quite deserted,
so I turned my attention to the other
window, and was presently accosted by a German
railway soldier. I at once surmised from his
opening remark and evil-looking face that he was
intent on "prisoner baiting." I naturally pretended
<a class="pagenum" name="page_200" title="200"> </a>
not to understand, and he thereupon
became most annoyed. The expression of his
humorous thought was that "the English were
all going to Berlin, and the verdammte English
would verdammt well stay there for ever." I shook
my head and said "nicht verstehe."</p>

<p>Then followed a sort of pantomime repetition of
the same idea slowly spoken in simple words.
Again I shook my head. Then a brilliant idea
struck him: "Parlez vous Français?" "Oui,"
said I. But all the French he could muster
consisted of "A Berlin." This was yelled out
in a loud voice with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I then constructed a sentence in very bad
German to the effect that our train was not going
to Berlin but to Munich. This got rid of him, as
he evidently thought it was hopeless to make the
thick-headed Engländer understand his subtle
German humour, and off he went shouting "A
Berlin, A Berlin!"</p>

<p>The fat N.C.O. who had been standing in the
corridor during this interview now came into the
carriage, and I asked him if there was any dinner
going, and was told that it would be brought
along presently. It was not long before a party
of soldiers appeared carrying two dixies of soup,
a plateful of which was handed up.</p>

<p>It was thin vegetable soup, tasteless and stone
cold. This was the "dinner from a restaurant
<a class="pagenum" name="page_201" title="201"> </a>
car" that Dr Schmidt had told me about! My
appetite would not rise to more than a spoonful of
it, and I do not think even Oliver Twist would
have asked for more. Fortunately my kind French
friend at Cambrai had provided me with a parcel
of food, and I thought the time had come to take
stock of its contents. I asked my corpulent
attendant to reach me down the parcel, in which
I found several "petit pains," some ham, and a
large lengthy German sausage, upon which, as it
rolled out of the paper, my guardian cast a swift
but appreciative eye. I thought it might be a
good idea to try and bribe him into a good temper,
and ventured to ask for the loan of a knife! My
request having been complied with, I sheared off
a large piece of the sausage and stuck it on the
end of the knife as I handed it back to its
owner.</p>

<p>A grateful grunt showed that my offering to the
stomach had found a weak spot in the enemy's
armour, and from that moment we were comparatively
friendly. After I had eaten some bread
and ham I asked for something to drink, and was
told that nothing was to be had except the thin
cold soup. I had saved one or two cheap cigars
from the hospital, and I settled down as best I
could to smoke one of them.</p>

<p>I have forgotten to mention that there was a
Red Cross attendant on the train, whose occupation
<a class="pagenum" name="page_202" title="202"> </a>
consisted in slouching in the corridor and
staring out of the window. He was a short, thick-set
man, one of the dirtiest-looking I have ever
seen in uniform. He wore a once white linen
overall and a Red Cross badge on his arm. I do
not know if he was qualified for Red Cross work,
as he made no attempt or offer to help me or any
of the other wounded men. Shortly after leaving
Mons I began to feel symptoms of a bad headache
coming on, and so I asked my guardian if there
was a doctor on the train and if he could give me
some aspirin. My request was passed on to the
Red Cross attendant, who said he would go and
ask the doctor.</p>

<p>It was now dark, and the train stopped at
many small stations, at each of which numbers
of soldiers were billeted. Some of them always
came up to my carriage to show off their knowledge
of English. One or two of them were very
rude, but the majority were merely interested and
addressed me quite politely, sometimes in fluent
English. One man I remember, who spoke just
like an Englishman, said that he had been twelve
years in England with a German band and knew
all the coast towns. This fellow said he was very
sorry "that England had made this War," as no
Germans would like to go back there any more.</p>

<p>At several stations other German bandsmen
spoke to me out of the darkness, and sometimes
<a class="pagenum" name="page_203" title="203"> </a>
they climbed up on to the footboard and attempted
to enter into discussions as to who started the
War. England, of course, was declared to be the
aggressor and originator of all the trouble, and
some surprise mingled with hatred was expressed
at her action in thus attacking, for no apparent
reason, a pacific industrial country like Germany.
Of course I was not in a position to argue the
point, and generally contented myself with asking
whether they thought we had prepared an
Expeditionary Force of 70,000 men to attack
7,000,000 Germans.</p>

<p>These men belonged for the most part to the
Landsturm, and one of them told me they had
been in billets for over two months. They
seemed quite cheerful at the prospect of going
nearer the firing line.</p>

<p>Conscription is, from the Germans' point of
view, simply organised patriotism, although ignorant
opponents of National Service are fond
of sneering at the German conscript and assert
that he will only fight when forced on with
revolvers. I wish that some of our stay-at-home
sneerers could have seen these crowds of German
conscripts and heard the singing and laughter.
If cheerfulness be one of the first qualities of a
soldier, these people possessed it to a very high
degree.</p>

<p>At one station a soldier who was, I think,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_204" title="204"> </a>
rather full of beer, hung on to the footboard outside
my window and attempted to be offensive
in a mixture of German and English. His peroration
was coming to an end as the train began
to move, but he clung on and delivered his final
shaft: "England is the enemy and will be punished."
However, his own punishment was near
at hand, for when he attempted to jump off the
train, which was running fairly fast, he made a
false step and fell heavily on the back of his
head, and, as it seemed to me, right under the
wheels of the train.</p>

<p>My sentry, who under the influence of sausage
had become quite communicative, remarked that
the man was drunk and deserved all he got.</p>

<p>Symptoms were now developing of a serious
headache such as I had experienced once before
in hospital. On asking the Red Cross attendant
if he had taken my message to the doctor, I was
told that it would have to wait till the next stop,
and by the time we got to Charleroi I was in the
fast grip of an acute neuralgic attack.</p>

<p>Entrance to the platform at Charleroi had
evidently been <i>verboten</i>, for there was no one on
the platform, although a great crowd of soldiers
could be seen at the far end of the station, which
was brilliantly lighted with electric arc lamps.</p>

<p>I again asked my sentry to get me some relief.
He was quite sympathetic, and I think began to
<a class="pagenum" name="page_205" title="205"> </a>
realise that I was getting rather bad. He told
me that the Red Cross attendant had gone to
the doctor and would be back before long. The
very great pain was made worse by the knowledge
that the two or three tablets of aspirin, for
which I had waited so long, would afford instant
relief. At last the Red Cross attendant came
along the corridor and made some sign to the
sentry, who went out to speak to him. They
talked for a long time, and seemed to be arguing
about something. Every minute was more painful
than the last, and then, to my relief, the sentry
came back. I stretched out my hand for the
aspirin. "Nichts," he said, "the doctor sends a
message&mdash;'tell the Englishman not to smoke
cigars and he will not have a headache.'"</p>

<p>Looking back now on this incident I am inclined
to acquit the German doctor of all blame,
although at the time I was full of wrath at what
I supposed to be callous indifference and cruelty,
surprising even in a German member of the
medical profession. The most likely explanation
is that the dirty Red Cross attendant had never
taken my message to the doctor at all.</p>

<p>The only thing now was to get some sleep
while the train was at rest, as I knew that when
the jolting began again sleep would be quite
impossible.</p>

<p>My desire for rest was not, however, to be
<a class="pagenum" name="page_206" title="206"> </a>
satisfied, for the sentry leant out of the window
on my side of the carriage and started a conversation
with somebody on the platform. I was
surprised to hear that he was talking to a woman,
and on looking up to see who it was, a pleasant
voice bade me "Good-evening" in perfect
English.</p>

<p>A pretty, young Red Cross nurse stood there at
the window. The sight of her, the kindness with
which she spoke, the sympathetic look, were for
a moment as unreal to me as the memory of
a dream. "Is there anything I can do for you?"
she said; "I hope you are not very badly
wounded." As soon as she knew of my headache
she went running along the train, and was
back almost at once with three large tablets of
aspirin. "I am so glad to be able to help you,"
she said; "I promised my friends in England
that I would do all in my power to help the
poor English wounded."</p>

<p>I could not find words to thank her then, and
I cannot find them now. Never did I need kindness
more, and never was a kind deed more kindly
done.</p>

<p>Before the train started off again the good
sister came back to ask how I was feeling, and
wished me well on my journey.</p>

<p>The relief to the pain was almost immediate,
and in spite of the renewed joltings, and the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_207" title="207"> </a>
hard bed which afforded small comfort to a
semi-paralysed man, I slept soundly for the rest
of the night.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The day had not long dawned when I awoke
so cramped and stiff that I could hardly move,
but still refreshed by much-needed sleep, and
above all free of the previous night's headache.
My sentry, who had also slept well, was good
enough to ask how I felt, and said we were going
to Aachen, but he could not or would not say if
this was to be our ultimate destination.</p>

<p>We reached Aachen about 8.30, and a more
miserable morning could not be imagined. It had
evidently rained hard all night, and the downpour
showed no signs of abating.</p>

<p>Looking out at the pretty little town half hidden
in the mist that hung over the wooded hills, I was
wondering if this was to be our journey's end, when
I saw what looked like two British officers walking
along the station road. There was no mistake
about the British warm coats! Of course they
were Germans, who doubtless found the British
uniform more suited than their own to the steadily
drenching rain.</p>

<p>Our journey was not, however, to finish here, for
soon the sentry, who had been standing in the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_208" title="208"> </a>
corridor, came back and said that we had to
change and get into another train.</p>

<p>When lifted down on to the platform I was too
stiff to walk even with the crutches, and had to
be taken across the station on a stretcher. There
were several other stretcher cases&mdash;about ten or
twelve&mdash;but the majority managed to hobble along
by themselves.</p>

<p>We were a most miserable-looking party; all the
men, both British and French, were dressed in
French uniforms, and one or two, whom I spoke
to, said that they had had no food since leaving
Cambrai.</p>

<p>The train into which we were now being packed
was of a more antiquated type than the one we had
left. A very narrow corridor ran down the centre
of the coach, the narrow wooden seats on each side
being made to hold four people. It was with great
difficulty that I crawled along the corridor through
the crowd of wounded soldiers, mostly French,
who, too miserable, too hungry and too cold for
speech, were trying to huddle together as well as
their wounded condition would allow.</p>

<p>The corridor led into a carriage with four very
narrow wooden seats, which were occupied by four
British soldiers and one stout sentry. This was
to be my accommodation for the rest of the
journey. I pointed out to my sentry, who had
followed me from the other train, that it was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_209" title="209"> </a>
impossible for me to travel otherwise than lying
down, and that even for able-bodied passengers
the carriage was overcrowded. Also I demanded
anew to be allowed to travel with the French
doctor, whom I now saw being escorted along
the platform to the rear end of the train. My
protest was of no avail, and on inquiring who
was the officer in charge of the train, I was told
it was the doctor who had refused the aspirin,
so concluded that further expostulation would be
useless. My luggage, consisting of a small canvas
portmanteau and a brown paper parcel with the
sausage, &amp;c., was now brought along, and took
up what small space remained in the carriage.</p>

<p>We were now five wounded men and two very
corpulent sentries, and the problem of how to divide
the available space presented some difficulty.</p>

<p>Two of the men, like myself, were unable to
travel in a sitting position. We had four seats,
one of which was more than occupied by the two
sentries. The other three had to be given to those
who could not sit up, and so the remaining two
men had to lie on the hard floor.</p>

<p>Although all these men had been very severely
wounded, and were still in great pain, they had no
thought for themselves, but insisted upon doing
everything that they could to settle me as comfortably
as possible. My bag was put at the end of
a corner seat, and, making a pillow with my greatcoat,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_210" title="210"> </a>
I was able to get into a half sitting, half
lying, and by no means comfortable position, but
the best that could be done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>A British Tommy's cheerfulness is irrepressible.
The knocking about may have been severe, the
situation may be desperate, and the outlook depressing,
but you will nearly always find the
British soldier cheerful in spite of all.</p>

<p>I remember an old monastic exhortation written
in the eighth century entitled, "De octo principalibus
vitiis," where sadness is bracketed along
with pride, covetousness, lust, and the other
familiar vices, while cheerfulness is placed high
on the list of virtues. I can now appreciate the
old monks' valuation of cheerfulness, and for the
lesson I have to thank those wounded soldiers in
the railway carriage at Aachen.</p>

<p>They were as cheery as soldiers on furlough.
For nearly four hours the train waited just outside
the dripping station, and we spent most of the time
laughing! In fact, we were so hilarious that I
think our sentries got suspicious; at any rate they
were considerably bewildered at our strange conduct.
We none of us had much to laugh at. The
most helpless man in our carriage was a young
fellow of nineteen in the K.O.S.B.'s, whose leg
had been broken just above the shin, and a piece of
the bone knocked away. This man was subsequently
<a class="pagenum" name="page_211" title="211"> </a>
exchanged, and we journeyed home to
England together. Two other men had bullet
wounds in the thigh which were still septic; and
the fourth, an Irishman from Carlow, had been
very badly wounded in the face, having lost the
sight of one eye, was also deaf in one ear and
shockingly disfigured.</p>

<p>The rain still poured heavily down, and we were
still, at 12.30&nbsp;<span class="small">P.M.</span>, outside Aachen station.</p>

<p>At last a man who looked like a soldier of high
rank, but was merely the station-master, came
in, escorted by a German private, to count us. He
informed our sentries that we were about to start
for Mainz, and before going out the German soldier
snatched the French képi from the disfigured
Irishman and gave him his German round soft
cap in exchange. It is a cheap and very common
method of obtaining a war trophy.</p>

<p>It was now time to make inquiries about lunch,
and we were told we would get nothing till we got
to Mainz at seven o'clock.</p>

<p>Every one of us had been supplied by the kind
French people at Cambrai with bread and cold
meat, chocolate and biscuits, so that we were able
to make quite a decent meal. Still I made a point
of always asking the Germans for food before using
our own. It was with the greatest difficulty that
we at last got something to drink. Our sentries
did not show any ill-feeling, and it was not their
<a class="pagenum" name="page_212" title="212"> </a>
fault that nothing was given us; it was simply
that no arrangements had been made. At about
four in the afternoon we each got a cup of what
was meant for tea, and this was the first liquid we
had had since the previous morning.</p>

<p>The sentries were provided with coffee and sandwiches
at every station, which was always brought
to the carriage by women dressed in uniform. They
belonged to an association which has been formed
for the purpose of supplying soldiers on transport
duty with hot drinks.</p>

<p>I inquired of one of these ladies if there was not
an association for supplying prisoners of war with
food and drink, and was rewarded with a solemn
serious negative.</p>

<p>The train did not get on very fast, and we stopped
a good many times just outside the stations&mdash;waits
lasting sometimes over an hour. Although the
amount of data regarding the internal conditions
of a country which can be obtained from a carriage
window on a journey such as we were making
is certainly not extensive, still I noted a good many
interesting points.</p>

<p>Civilians, of course, were few and far between.
At the stations and in the public places, and as
far as I could see in the streets, nearly all were
in uniform, young and old. Some of the older
men wore very quaint-looking garments. I have
seen more civilians on the platform of one English
<a class="pagenum" name="page_213" title="213"> </a>
country station than I saw at all the German
stations together between Cambrai and Würzburg.</p>

<p>Railway work, such as unloading coal, &amp;c., from
the trucks, was being done by boys of twelve to
fifteen, working in gangs of about six, doing the
work of two or three men. <i>All</i> the railway engine-drivers
and employees I saw were men obviously
above military age.</p>

<p>The stations are all under military control, and
transport work is carried on by soldiers.</p>

<p>Troop trains passed incessantly. The men, who
I should say were about twenty years old, were
cheerful and always singing, just like our own
troops are fond of doing, only the Germans sing
much better! They shouted out greetings to the
wounded Germans on our train, and looked with
curiosity at the French and British soldiers. When
the troop train happened to draw up opposite us,
sometimes a fist would be shaken in the air,
accompanied by what sounded like very bad language.
But the general spirit shown by these young
German troops towards our train-load of wounded
prisoners was that of contempt and pity of victors
for the vanquished. The men were splendidly
equipped, and many regiments carried a long spade
strapped on to the back of their kit, the iron head
stretching high above the helmet. I remember
starting to count the troop trains, but I cannot
<a class="pagenum" name="page_214" title="214"> </a>
find any note of the number in my diary. I should
put the number we saw in one day at from fifteen
to twenty.</p>

<p>In the public squares of the smaller towns, and
even outside some of the country villages, groups
of youths, almost children, were being put through
elementary military exercises.</p>

<p>The train stopped at one small countryside
station, and I got a very good view of some German
troops having a field-day. They were preparing
to advance on the village through some
woods, and the sight reminded me of the German
attacks on our trenches at Mons.</p>

<p>Nothing that I could observe from my carriage
window spoke more eloquently of the efforts Germany
was making than the goods traffic which
passed along the line or lay shunted at the stations.</p>

<p>The very trucks themselves were eloquent of
war and of Germany's success in war. Belgian
rolling stock was very much in evidence, and it
was depressing to see the well-known French vans
with the inscription, "hommes 40, chevaux 12,"
familiar to all who have travelled in France.
There were also a few strange-looking waggons,
either Russian or Polish.</p>

<p>Nearly all the goods trains were carrying war
material. Long trains were standing on the sidings
with Red Cross ambulances on every truck.</p>

<p>We passed countless numbers of trains loaded
<a class="pagenum" name="page_215" title="215"> </a>
with broad wooden planks and stout larch poles,
doubtless intended for the erection of earthworks.
Most instructive was the sight of one long train
of about thirty trucks loaded with private motor-cars
of all sorts and sizes, which had been hurriedly
painted with grey stripes and some sort of notice
indicating Government service. Once we passed
a train with heavy artillery on specially constructed
waggons, and we saw several trains of ordinary
field artillery. These trains of troops, munitions,
motor-cars, coal, and a hundred other weapons
of war that were hidden from view, the whole
methodical procession of supplies to the Front,
were most suggestive of power, of concentration,
and organisation of effort. Most impressive was
this glimpse of Germany at war. It is difficult
to convey the impression to those who have not
seen Germany in a state of war. Men who have
been at the Front see little of the power which
is behind the machine against which they are
fighting.</p>

<p>I do not think many people in this country, even
in high places, have yet understood how great,
as to be almost invincible, are the military and
industrial resources of Germany.</p>

<p>The strength given by unity of purpose, by self-sacrifice
of individual to national requirements,
by organisation of disciplined masses, is the
strength of Germany, behind which is the all-prevailing
<a class="pagenum" name="page_216" title="216"> </a>
spirit of the motto, "Deutschland über
Alles," the Fatherland above all things, and before
all things. The end justifying the means in the
name of a perverted patriotism, whose end is self-glorification,
whose means include among other
horrors the murder of an innocent and defenceless
civilian population.</p>

<p>This German patriotism, a monstrous caricature
of the noblest of virtues, is the only ideal which
the brutal materialism of Prussia can still pretend
to claim for its own.</p>

<p>Chivalry, honour, and a fair name, the ideals
for which men will cheerfully die, Germany has
destroyed and buried in the wreckage of Belgian
homesteads.</p>

<p>In my carriage-window conversations with
German soldiers, to whom it might have been
dangerous to express myself as frankly as I have
just done here, I always felt that I was dealing
with people possessed by an "idée fixe." Evil,
as long as it was German evil, was right.</p>

<p>Pride has brought these people to believe that
all law, religious and ethical, should be subservient
to the interests of the Fatherland. The German
pride is something quite apart from the common
conceit with which all men and all nations are
afflicted, for the foolish British bumptiousness,
which of late years has not been so much in
evidence, due to ignorance and want of intercourse
<a class="pagenum" name="page_217" title="217"> </a>
with Continental nations, does not strike deep
enough into the national character to affect the
moral sanity of the race. But German pride
working through several generations has apparently
destroyed all sense of right and wrong. It has
become, therefore, impossible to convince the
German people of wrong-doing.</p>

<p>I once ventured to say, in answer to one man
who was very indignant with "England's treachery"
(he was a kultured man and addressed me as a
"hireling of La Perfide Albion"), that at any rate
we had not invaded Belgium in breach of a solemn
treaty. I fully expected to be chastised for my
boldness, but my remark did not arouse any indignation.
I was told quite simply that "even if
there was any truth in my statement the necessity
of Germany was supreme and above all."</p>

<p>Deutschland über Alles.</p>

<p>At most of the stations we stopped at, men used
to come into our carriage out of curiosity; some
of them were rude and insulting, but very often
they were eager to enter into conversation.</p>

<p>At one place an <i>Unterofficier</i>, who understood a
little English but did not speak it, kept on repeating
in German that England had made the
War and tried to catch Germany unprepared, and
that we were mobilised for war in July. I did not
answer him, but turned round to the wounded
soldier next me and said to him, "When did
<a class="pagenum" name="page_218" title="218"> </a>
you mobilise?" All the men answered in chorus,
"On the 5th August." "I don't know when you
Germans mobilised," I said, "but you were fighting
in Belgium on the day we mobilised."</p>

<p>In most of their conversations the question of
who was going to win was not raised, for the
Germans consider that they have won already, and
they have no fears of being unable to maintain
the territory they have conquered.</p>

<p>The prevailing sentiment towards England was
contemptuous. I remember some soldiers at one
place reading the news to my sentry out of a
German paper, and one of the items was
"Kitchener has organised an army of one million
men." This statement caused considerable
laughter, and when the sentry returned to our
carriage I asked him where the joke lay. England,
he then explained, for years had employed a small
number of paid men to do whatever fighting was
needed, and the nation could not now be drilled
and made soldiers of, as they were not animated
by the martial, manly spirit of Germany, and those
few that did volunteer&mdash;he used the word with
contempt&mdash;would require at least a year's training.</p>

<p>From such conversations as these, and from
reading the German papers, I am convinced that
the strongest ground of confidence the Germans
possess is their contempt of England's military
power. The Germans know far better than we
<a class="pagenum" name="page_219" title="219"> </a>
do the weakness of our voluntary system. They
know that if the full power of the British Empire
was brought against them, defeat would in the
long-run be inevitable. But they believe, and I
think rightly believe, that this can never come to
pass without organisation and discipline of the
whole country. No disaster to the German arms
on the field of battle would have an effect on the
morale of the German people such as would result
from the knowledge that the English had recognised
the principle of National Service.</p>

<p>But as long as England remains "le pays des
embusqués," German opinion will not be influenced
by speeches on England's grim determination
made in Parliament or leaders written in our
morning papers: Germany knows that grim determination
is shown not in words, but in deeds.</p>

<p>The day when England consents to the great
sacrifice and faces the stern discipline of conscription,
the present unshakable confidence of
the German people will be changed into apprehensive
despair.</p>

<p>I have interrupted the thread of my story to
reply to those people who keep on telling us that
we have done splendidly, that no one else could
have done what we have done; that our voluntary
army of one or two or three million men, whatever
it may be, is the most wonderful creation of
all history; and so on to the Navy and its great
<a class="pagenum" name="page_220" title="220"> </a>
deeds. The litany of praise is familiar to all, and
a good deal of it is true.</p>

<p>But the point to be considered is not what we
have done, but what we have left undone, since
nothing less will suffice than the maximum
possible effort.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>I forgot to mention that either at Mons or
Charleroi, I am not sure which, a sheet of paper
containing all the latest war news, some printed
in English and some in French, was handed to
all the prisoners on the train. I have kept this
interesting document, the heading of which is as
follows: "A short account of facts from Official
German and Foreign War Reports. 'This english
[<i>sic</i>] is also published in German and Spanish.'
Free of charge from the Publisher, Mrs von Puttkamer,
Hamburg, Paulstrasse 9/11."</p>

<p>This sheet, which purports to contain the war
news for November, is evidently a monthly concoction.
I append some extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>Nov. 1.</i> "Turkey declares the 'holy War.' 2000 armed
Bedouins attack Egypt. As a result of bad treatment
17 Germans die in the English Concentration
Camp at Farmley."</p>

<p class="newspaper"><a class="pagenum" name="page_221" title="221"> </a>
<i>Nov. 5.</i> "Field-Marshal French meets with a bad accident.
Conquered English cannons placed for
exhibition before the Hamburg Town Hall, amidst
the plaudits of the people."</p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>Nov. 6.</i> "As a counter measure all Englishmen in Germany
between the ages of 17 and 55 interned at
Ruhleben by Berlin."</p>

<p>Then follows a long list of German victories
on all fronts, with just a passing reference to
the loss of the <i>Emden</i> and the fall of Tsingtau.</p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>Nov. 15.</i> "Storm of indignation from all Mohammedens
over the English attack against Akaba, the Holy
City of Islam. Lord Roberts dies in London at

<p class="newspaper"><i>Nov. 17.</i> "As a result of German submarines in the

place."</p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>Nov. 18.</i> "The Times says that it is becoming clearer
every day to prominent patriots of Germany, that
it is not possible to beat England. 'As I also
belong to the leading men mentioned, I attach
great importance to it, to prove well founded the
fact that, in my opinion, England is already beaten,
as an England that hides its fleet in such a war as
this, and does not venture to sea, has ceased to be
the England of old. It has once for all renounced
its right to speak when a question of the European
balance of power is dealt with.'&mdash;<i>Ballin.</i>"</p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>Nov. 22.</i> "Successful fight of the Turks against English

The total number of prisoners claimed to have
been captured in the month of November works
out at 268,508, and on one single day, the 14th
Nov., 10,000 guns and a quantity of ammunition
were taken as booty.</p>

<p>Mrs von Puttkamer must have taken considerable
trouble with this singular document, and I
cannot understand with what object it was distributed
broadcast among the prisoners. The only
result of reading such an obviously biassed account
of the war was that, as we had no means of discriminating
between what was true and what was
false, we did not pay the least attention to any of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>The three wounded men who had been over four
months in bed, and whose wounds were not yet
healed, were now suffering a great deal of pain from
the cramped position, the jolting of the train, and
from want of nourishing food. They had tried to
get some relief by lying on the floor of the carriage,
where they finally settled together in a heap.</p>

<p>The sentry, with whom I was by this time on
the best of terms, began to grow sentimental at
the thought of meeting his wife and children, with
whom he was to spend a week's leave in the neighbourhood
of Coblenz. I tried to find out if he had
heard of any talk about a proposed exchange of
prisoners, but he could not or would not give me
any information.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_223" title="223"> </a>
Light was failing as we reached the Rhine
valley. The train crawled slowly under the
shadow of the vine-covered cliffs, far to the
west the rain-clouds were drifting away as if
driven by the last rays of the setting sun, which
they had hidden during the day. We had no light
in the carriage, and the blackness of the interior
darkness was relieved only by the twinkling lights
on the distant banks of the Rhine. By the time
the train reached Coblenz the wounded men,
though not asleep, were in a condition of dormant
torpor, while the sentries slept heavily,
dreaming, no doubt, of their soon-once-more-to-be-met
buxom fraus.</p>

<p>At Coblenz most of the German wounded who
had started with us from Cambrai came to their
journey's end, and the station was crowded with
Red Cross people who had come to meet them.
There were no serious cases, nearly all arms and
a few superficial head wounds. Here also we saw
the last of our two fat sentries, and their place was
taken by two men who belonged to some very
antiquated sort of Bavarian Landsturm, harmless,
inoffensive creatures both of them. They actually
put their rifles up on the rack, whereas the other
sentries had clung tight to theirs on the whole
journey from Cambrai. We immediately got permission
to smoke, which had been refused us before,
and I again made inquiries about food and drink
<a class="pagenum" name="page_224" title="224"> </a>
with the usual result. No arrangements had been
made for feeding prisoners, and as our own stock
of food was getting low an effort had to be made to
get something done.</p>

<p>It was not long before the doctor in charge of
the Coblenz ambulance, tall and thin, with a black
beard, came along inspecting the wounded. He
asked if there were any men who required to have
their wounds dressed, explaining that we would
get to our destination the next day, and he would
not dress any one except if absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The men said they preferred to wait, and I then
pointed out to the doctor that the accommodation
for five badly wounded men was insufficient, so
that they had to lie on top of each other on the
floor, and that we had been given practically no
food since we left Cambrai.</p>

<p>The doctor answered that no other accommodation
was available, and he expressed some indignation
at our not having had any food, promising to
send some along at once. We got some nice hot
coffee, a large piece of German black bread, with a
roll and sausage each, and made our first meal at
German expense.</p>

<p>After the train started on again the big sentry,
who looked rather like a Scotch Highlander, and
came no doubt from the mountain forests of Bavaria,
produced a couple of night-lights, with whose
slender flickering the carriage was dimly lit up.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_225" title="225"> </a>
Our new sentries had no idea of discipline or
duty whatever. They seemed to look upon themselves
as showmen travelling with a collection of
curious beasts, for at every station where we stopped
people took it in turns to come right into the
carriage, and we met with considerable annoyance
and impertinence from many of them. One German,
who said he was shortly going to the front to kill
some Engländer, tried to drag my greatcoat from
me, but this was too much for the sentry, who
ordered him to desist.</p>

<p>Owing to the constant entry of these unwelcome
visitors it now became impossible to think of sleep,
for whenever I tried or pretended to doze I was
pulled up and asked to answer some impertinent
questions.</p>

<p>The type of German soldier that now began to
predominate was of a far different class to what we
had met with before. It is probable that the men
we had conversed with between Cambrai and
Coblenz had been to a certain extent tamed by
experience at the front, whereas the older and more
ignorant class of Landsturm, who at every station
forced their attentions upon us, spoke to us and
about us as if we were dangerous criminals, and on
several occasions if it had not been for the sentries
we would have been roughly handled.</p>

<p>It was at Aschaffenburg, on the Bavarian frontier,
that we had occasion to be really alarmed at
<a class="pagenum" name="page_226" title="226"> </a>
the hostile attitude of the crowd on the station
platform.</p>

<p>We reached Aschaffenburg at three in the morning,
and were informed that we were to stop there
for five hours. There was nothing for it but to try
and get some sleep; this, however, was not to be
allowed. A curious-looking mob of men dressed in
bits of all uniforms collected outside our carriage
and proceeded to go through a pantomimic exhibition
of hate. The leader of this mob was a nasty-looking
ruffian, more than half drunk, who kept
calling on us to come outside and fight; also
threatening to come inside and cut our throats,
and brandishing a big pocket-knife, he looked quite
up to doing it. However, the mob, which was
getting more and more excited, was eventually dispersed
by an officer, who rebuked them for insulting
men who were defenceless and disabled.</p>

<p>After the dispersal of this collection of ruffians,
who looked as if they had stepped off the stage of a
comic opera, we still continued to be plagued by a
constant stream of visitors. One group of these
soldiers came in about five in the morning and
behaved with great rudeness and brutality. The
wounded men had by this time settled on to the
floor of the carriage, all in a heap, and had fallen
off to sleep.</p>

<p>The sentry was telling our visitors that one of
the Engländer had been shot in the face and was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_227" title="227"> </a>
badly disfigured; whereupon a German soldier
pulled the poor fellow out of the sleeping mass on
the floor and sat him upon the seat, the others
standing round pointing with their fingers at the
poor mutilated face with coarse jeering laughter.
The young Irish soldier sat patiently through it
all&mdash;his blind eye was a running sore, the torn
cheek in healing had left a hideously scarred
hollow, and the mouth and nose were twisted
to one side. His condition would have stirred
pity in the heart of a savage, and yet these
Germans laughed and jeered.</p>

<p>This scene comes back to me with a fresh bitterness
when I see the able-bodied young civilians in
this country&mdash;they must number several millions&mdash;who
should be ashamed to be seen alive until the
perpetration of deeds such as these have been
brought to account.</p>

<p>This poor fellow came from County Carlow. Is
there a man in Carlow or in all Ireland who could
have witnessed this scene unmoved?</p>

<p>So much stronger is the impression of things
seen than things heard that, although I have
second-hand evidence of far worse horrors&mdash;of
wounded men shot, of men of a well-known regiment
kicked and beaten along the road to a German
prison&mdash;none of these things, no atrocity of
Louvain, no story of women and children tortured,
has moved me so much to a deep loathing of Germany
<a class="pagenum" name="page_228" title="228"> </a>
as the pathetic sight of this young Irishman
and his heartless tormentors.</p>

<p>Reading this morning's <i>Times</i>, I find that Mr T.&nbsp;P.
O'Connor used in the House of Commons the
following words: "The Irish people have a loathing
of the very name of conscription." I have no
means of ascertaining how far this be true, but
whether true or not, I know that if the Irish people
could see this war as it really is, as the Germans
have made it, there is scarcely a man throughout
the length and breadth of Ireland who would not
make any sacrifice in order that such horror should
be avenged.</p>

<p>From three to half-past eight we had waited at
Aschaffenburg subjected to a continuous round of
insult, painfully cramped on the hard benches, and
half frozen with the cold of a frosty January morning,
so that it was a relief when the train at last
moved on.</p>

<p>Our route now lay through the beautifully wooded
hills of the Bavarian Highlands, and the countryside
reminded me in many ways of Speyside. The
air blowing from the spruce woods was most refreshing,
and in spite of the cold we were glad to
have the pale winter sunshine streaming in through
the open windows.</p>

<p>Our train was now reduced to two coaches, which
had been hitched on to a local country train, and so
we advanced more slowly than ever, and stopped at
<a class="pagenum" name="page_229" title="229"> </a>
the very smallest stations. We seemed at last to
be getting away from the omnipresent German
soldier, for the wild-looking country through which
we were passing did not look as if there had ever
been any inhabitants, and on the station platforms
an occasional soldier on leave was the only reminder
of war that could be seen.</p>

<p>The sentries, perhaps relieved at being in their
native wilds, became quite talkative, and we were
soon on most friendly terms. As no breakfast was
to be hoped for from any of the stations, we agreed
to pool what provisions we could get together
between us. I had nothing but half of my German
sausage, the other men had some bread, and the
sentries produced two bottles of cold coffee, so we
were all able to make quite a good meal.</p>

<p>This surprising atmosphere of cordiality was
marred by a visit of inspection. A very shabby
<i>Unterofficier</i> suddenly opened the door leading into
the corridor, and proceeded to pour a volume of
abuse on us all, finally settling upon me as being the
only representative of the enemy who seemed to
understand what it was all about.</p>

<p>I did not indeed understand very much, but could
gather that the substance of his complaints was
that we were too comfortable, and should have been
travelling in a truck! After this excited individual
had passed away, I asked the sentries what all the
discourse was about, and they said that the fellow
<a class="pagenum" name="page_230" title="230"> </a>
enjoyed getting a chance to scold somebody, as he
was constantly in trouble with his superior officer,
and got more than the usual share of slanging that
falls to the lot of the German soldier.</p>

<p>On leaving Aschaffenburg we had been definitely
assured that our destination was Nuremburg, and
for that reason, when at about 11 o'clock the train
entered the picturesque valley of the river Main, on
the banks of which the town of Würzburg is situated,
I little thought that here was the end of our
journey, and here was to be our future prison
home.</p>

<p>Hardly had we drawn up at the station when it
became obvious that our destination had been
reached.</p>

<p>A number of Red Cross officials were on the
platform, which was lined with stretchers. There
was no time for more than a hurried farewell, but
before leaving the carriage the young Irishman,
whose name was Patrick Flynn, begged me to
accept the only thing he had to give me as a
souvenir, and pressed into my hand a Belgian five-centime
nickel coin, which I shall always keep in
remembrance of the unselfish kindness with which
these poor wounded soldiers treated me on our long
and painful journey.</p>

CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="small">WÜRZBURG.</span></h2>


<p class="small">"Turbatus est a furore oculus meus; inveteravi inter omnes
inimicos meus."&mdash;<i>Psalm</i> vi.&nbsp;8.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Würzburg, before leaving the
railway carriage, all the soldiers except myself
were handed a slip of coloured paper marked
"Hütte Barracken No.&nbsp;14." A most unpleasant-looking
person, who spoke a little English, and
wore a very superior air, was in command of the
stretcher-party that carried me across the station.
I kept asking for my luggage, a hand-bag and a
fragment of the German sausage which had been
left in the carriage, and was told it would follow
later, and meantime was, like myself, safe in good
German hands. However, my valuable belongings
were eventually put on the stretcher beside me.
While waiting on the platform my English-speaking
attendant volunteered the information that there
were already over 200 British officers in the place.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_232" title="232"> </a>
This was lying for lying's sake, or perhaps it was
a lie told to the wrong person, and should have
been reserved for the citizens of Würzburg. The
morning was a bitterly cold one, and the arrangements
made for our transport from the station gave
us the full benefit of the freezing north-easterly
wind. The vehicle into which the stretchers were
lifted does not deserve the name of ambulance, nor
had it any pretension to the title, for it was not
even honoured with a Red Cross. It was just a
common lorry, such as is used in the district for
carting wood, covered with a tarpaulin supported
by a longitudinal bar on transverse stays. The
tarpaulin, which had been rolled up on one side
while the stretchers were being placed in position,
was rolled down again. A German ambulance
man jumped up behind and off we went. Each
stretcher was provided with a blanket, which
afforded some small protection from the cold blast
which blew through the open end of the cart.
None of the soldiers with whom I had travelled
from France were in this cart, and at first I thought
that all the occupants were Frenchmen. But the
man next me was an Englishman, dressed in French
uniform, who had been with me in hospital at Cambrai.
His face was so drawn and haggard that I
had some difficulty in recognising him. This poor
fellow would not answer me at first, and then
whispered that he did not want the German Red
<a class="pagenum" name="page_233" title="233"> </a>
Cross attendant to know that he was an Englishman,
and hoped to pass for a Frenchman as long
as possible, so as to get better treatment. The
other Frenchmen lay silent and motionless, worn
out with exhaustion and want of food. By slightly
rising on my side, I could see following far
behind us a long string of carts similar to our
own. The wind, which was now chasing here and
there some few fine drifting snow-flakes, had doubtless
kept the streets clear of pedestrians, and there
were few spectators of the dolorous procession.
Some small boys fell in behind, and played at
soldiers escorting a convoy, marching in step and
singing in tune, only to be chased away presently
by a watchful policeman. We crossed a stone
bridge over the Main and almost immediately
turned in, on our left, through the high wooden
palisade which surrounded the hospital huts&mdash;our
temporary destination.</p>

<p>The tarpaulin was quickly rolled up, and my four
companions lifted down on their stretchers and
taken away. My stretcher was lifted on to the
ground, and remained there for five or ten minutes,
close to a group of officers, one of whom appeared
very annoyed at my having been brought to the
wrong place; he presently came up and politely
asked me my name and rank in very good English.
This, I afterwards discovered, was Dr Zinck.
He told me that I was to be sent up to the fortress.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_234" title="234"> </a>
I was helped off the stretcher, and, owing to the
cold, had great difficulty in hobbling along, and
was very relieved to find that I was to drive up to
the castle in a comfortable motor <i>coupé</i>, probably
the one used by the doctor himself. A hospital
orderly got up beside the driver, and a very tall
sentry, who had great difficulty in getting in his
rifle with the bayonet fixed, squeezed in beside me.</p>

<p>The Festung Marienberg, about a mile outside
the city of Würzburg, is a place of great architectural
and historic interest. Previous to the days
of heavy artillery, the hill on which the fortress is
built provided a naturally impregnable site, which
had been used for defensive purposes from the
earliest times of which any historic trace has been
recorded. When St&nbsp;Kilian in the seventh century
brought Christianity to Franconia from far Iona,
he was at first very successful at the "Castellum
Virtebuch," and converted the Frankish commander.
A few years later a chapel was built
within the walls, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin
Mary, and the fortress became known as Festung
Marienberg.</p>

<p>In the middle ages the castle was famous as a
stronghold of the warrior bishops of Würzburg,
and stood firm during the revolutionary periods
which followed on the teachings of Huss and
Luther, even when the surrounding country had
been laid waste, and the town of Würzburg captured
<a class="pagenum" name="page_235" title="235"> </a>
by a rebel army. Once after the peasant
army had been betrayed, surrounded, and almost
annihilated, the unfortunate survivors were taken
away to the Festung Marienberg. "Thirty-six of
them," says a contemporary writer, "had their
heads cut off, and the council and aldermen have
been taken prisoners; God only knows what will
be done with them." It was a common punishment
in those days for a prisoner to have his eyes
gouged out, or his fingers chopped off. At the
present time these somewhat barbaric customs
have been considerably modified, and although the
Rittmeister who was in command of the fortress
during my residence there did not resort to such
extreme measures in dealing with his prisoners as
had been found necessary in the sixteenth century
by the Margrave of Brandenburg, he did his best,
as I was soon to find out, to make us feel the burden
of captivity.</p>

<p>As the motor began to climb a rather steep
gradient, the silent sentry, with a wave of his hand,
introduced me to the outer battlements of the
Festung Marienberg. Between this outer wall and
the castle moat, the long steep slope on the west
side has been laid out as a garden with shrubs and
well-grown trees. "There," said my sentry, "is
where the officers can make their daily promenade."
This I need hardly say was not to be our privilege.
The second wall is of great thickness, so that the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_236" title="236"> </a>
entrance is like a tunnel, the gradient of the road
being so steep as to bring the car down to the
first speed. We cross a courtyard with stables on
the three sides, and then pass through a third
doorway, and drive over the moat into the main
court of the castle.</p>

<p>This inner court, of oblong shape, is some 60 to
70 yards long and about 30 broad.</p>

<p>On two sides were the soldiers' quarters, built in
the middle of the eighteenth century. The ground
floor on the left was used as a stable, and above
the stables were the prisoners' rooms. A fifteenth-century
chapel stands in the far corner on the site
chosen by St&nbsp;Kilian. An aggressive watch-tower,
dating from the eleventh century if not earlier, tall
and massive, is the most interesting feature in the
curious medley of architecture, which presents a
graphic picture of the castle's history.</p>

<p>The motor drew up at the far end of the court.
I was then helped out of the car and formally
handed over to a German N.C.O. named Poerringer,
who had charge of the prisoners, collected
their letters, &amp;c., &amp;c.,&mdash;in fact he was our jailor.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p236i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">
  The Courtyard and Chapel, Festung Marienberg.</p>
</div>

<p>We entered the fortress buildings through a small
doorway in one of the old towers, and the broad
spiral stairway proved almost too much for my
powers of locomotion. However, with a helping
arm under each shoulder, they got me along.
Half-way up the stair we turned through a door on
<a class="pagenum" name="page_237" title="237"> </a>
our right, which led into a large and very medieval-looking
guard-room, a long, low room faintly lit up
by narrow windows deeply set in immensely thick
walls. In one of these window recesses was a
desk and chair barred off from the rest of the
room with temporary wooden cross-bars. I was
led into this cage, and told to sit down and
wait to be interviewed by Mr Poerringer. My
luggage was brought up and put down beside
me, and a sentry took his position near at
hand.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' rest I began to look around,
and as my eyes got used to the dim light I saw
my friend the French doctor sitting on a chair
farther up the room within speaking distance.
A thoughtless <i>Bonjour, Docteur</i>, raised the wrath
of the sentry, who turned in my direction
and grunted out a sentence which ended in
<i>verboten</i>.</p>

<p>The guard-room then began to fill with soldiers;
the loud tramping, the guttural words of command,
the curious antique unmilitary-looking
uniform, the crowd of squat, slouching, and for
the most part bearded, round-bellied creatures,
formed in the dim light a picture that might
have belonged to a land of gnomes, wicked
princes, and enchanted castles.</p>

<p>Such at least was my first impression. Our
middle-aged sentries in broad daylight were anything
<a class="pagenum" name="page_238" title="238"> </a>
but romantic. Their uniform consisted of
Hessian boots, civilian trousers, and dirty green
jacket, and always a big black leather belt to
keep in the rebellious stomach. They appeared
most of them to be wood-cutters, charcoal-burners,
workers in the beautiful forests of
Franconia, who did not take kindly to the monotonous
duty of guarding prisoners, and to a
discipline little less strict than that of the
prisoners themselves.</p>

<p>After the ceremony of changing the guard had
been completed, and all arms had been examined
to make sure they were loaded, Mr Poerringer,
who was in undress uniform, and did not go
about with a ridiculous bayonet, came back with
some papers which had to be filled in, and by
virtue of which my official status as a prisoner
would be completed. My luggage was examined
courteously and as a matter of form. I was
asked if I had any fountain-pens, maps, or firearms!
concealed in my belongings.</p>

<p>So far, conversation had been carried on in
English, of which my jailor could speak but
little.</p>

<p>Before leaving Cambrai I had forgotten to look
up the most commonly used German word for
"paralysed," and the friendly Highland sentry in
the train, whose German was no doubt not of
the best, had told me that the correct word was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_239" title="239"> </a>
"Gicht." I tried this word when explaining the
cause of my lameness to Mr Poerringer, and was
much astonished at the result. "Is that all that
is the matter?" said he; "you will soon get
cured here." Weary of trying to make myself
understood, I protested somewhat impatiently in
French that there was not much point in bringing
a half-paralysed man into such a carefully-guarded
prison. With a most Parisian accent
he replied: "Oh, vous êtes paralysé, moi qui
croyai que vous aviez la goutte!"</p>

<p>We now, of course, got on very much quicker
with the filling-in of papers. One entry, headed
"Request to Prison Governors," I wished to fill
up with a request to be sent back to England,
according to rules laid down in the Hague Convention.
Mr Poerringer shook his head, and said
there would be no exchanges until the war was
over. My request for a room to myself, so that
I could hope for sleep, was not passed, no such
room being available, and the column was left a
blank. In this first interview Mr Poerringer was
trying hard, probably under orders, to put on a
fierceness of manner which was obviously quite
foreign to his nature. I subsequently found that
in dealing with the prisoners, both French and
English, he always displayed a kindly courteousness
which was strikingly in contrast with the
behaviour of his superior officers.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_240" title="240"> </a>
Still escorted by a watchful sentry armed to the
teeth, I was assisted up the broad spiral staircase
to the door leading into the prisoners' quarters.
Mr Poerringer pressed an electric bell, and yet
another heavily-burdened warrior appeared who
led us into a broad, stone-flagged, whitewashed
corridor, well lit with large windows overlooking
the courtyard, a cold inhospitable-looking place.
A more welcome sight than any I had for a
long time been accustomed to was that of two
British officers hurrying forward to meet me, one
of whom was Irvine, who had been with me in
the Civil Hospital at Cambrai, and was much
surprised to see me on my feet again. We all
marched along to the room which had been
allotted to me&mdash;the smallest of the five rooms
which opened into the corridor, occupied by nine
French officers, who were then seated at a long
table enjoying their midday meal. My new-found
British comrades introduced me to the
senior officer, Colonel Lepeltier, who welcomed
me with the greatest kindness, and offered me
the best that could be supplied from their private
store of food and drink, including a bottle of
very excellent Bavarian beer, for which, after the
exhaustion of the past few days, I felt most
thankful. The room, which served as living and
sleeping room for ten officers, was none too
large. The furniture consisted of the large wooden
<a class="pagenum" name="page_241" title="241"> </a>
dining-table, a small wooden table and chair for
each officer, two washhand-stands, and two chests
of drawers shared among the lot. We had, of
course, no carpets, wall-paper, or curtains, and no
facilities for getting hot water. Two windows
looked out over the Main, between them a large
and very efficient stove. I looked with apprehension
at my "bed"&mdash;a wooden plank scarcely three
feet broad, on iron trestles; at the "mattress"&mdash;a
coarse linen sack open on one side, and stuffed
with straw, renewed, I was told, once a month.
The two English officers, Irvine and Reddy, with
an English civilian, Parke, lived in a large room
adjoining ours, along with ten French officers.
Two other large barrack-rooms were also occupied
by French officers, the total number in the fortress
at the time being between forty and fifty.</p>

<p>It was arranged that I should take my meals in
the adjoining room, where the Englishmen had
their three beds together in a corner known as
"the English Club." On the day of my arrival
the "Club" held a long sitting, which was attended
by many of the French officers, eager to hear what
news there might be from Cambrai. Time passed
quickly that afternoon. Irvine had much to tell
me, and many questions to ask about friends at
Cambrai, and Captain Reddy and Parke gave me
an outline of their misfortunes. Reddy had been
more unfortunate than any of us. He was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_242" title="242"> </a>
travelling in Austria before the war broke out,
and was arrested on his way home before war
had actually been declared. Along with Parke
and a number of British civilians, men and women,
who were travelling in the same train, he was
stopped at Aschaffenburg and taken first to the
police station and then to prison. The whole
party were locked up in separate cells to be
searched; even children of eight or ten years were
dragged screaming with terror from their mothers,
and locked away by themselves. I do not remember
many details of the story, but Reddy and
Parke told me that it was a very near thing for
them both; they were suspected and vehemently
accused of being spies, of which baseless charge
there was, of course, not the faintest shred of
evidence.</p>

<p>I was glad to learn that the austerity of our
prison life was mitigated to some extent by permission
to buy extras in the town. A list of
commissions was made up weekly, and might
include jam, honey, cream-cheese, dried fruits,
articles of toilet, and beer. Every prisoner was
entitled at this time to write one letter a day. A
hot bath was to be had once a month, prisoners
being taken down in batches under strong escort
to public baths at Würzburg. The doctor came
once a week to see all who needed attention; an
occasional inspection, and a weekly visit from
<a class="pagenum" name="page_243" title="243"> </a>
the hairdresser, completed the list of important
events in the deadly dull routine.</p>

<p>The food supplied by the authorities was, on
the whole, of bad quality, badly cooked, and
insufficient.</p>

<div class="menuetable">

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The English Club usually spent the interval
between dinner and bed in a game of cards, but
on this my first night I was too tired to make a
fourth at bridge, and hobbled off to my own
quarters under the severe gaze of three unfortunate
sentries who had to spend most of the night marching
up and down the cold clammy corridor.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_244" title="244"> </a>
On arriving at "Room 52" the noisiest game of
cards in the world, known as "La Manille," was in
full swing, the air was thick with tobacco smoke,
and empty bottles of beer stood in serried ranks
on the table. Monsieur l'Abbé was playing with
the Doctor against Colonel Lepeltier and another
officer whom I privately nicknamed "Granny."
Granny's main ambition in life seemed to be to
escape from fresh air, and even in the close
atmosphere of tobacco smoke and fumes from the
red-hot stove he was wearing all the underclothing
he could put on, and round his neck a huge
muffler.</p>

<p>The presence of M.&nbsp;l'Abbé in the uniform of a
private soldier was the result of an appeal by the
Pope to the German Emperor to allow priests
serving in the French army the same privilege
when taken prisoners as are accorded to officers.</p>

<p>I cannot describe Colonel Lepeltier better than
by saying that he represented the typical soldier
of Napoleonic days. His career in Saharan and
Moroccan campaigns had already proved him to
be a leader of no ordinary merit. He possessed
a great number of medals, which, as a prisoner,
he did not wear, and had been wounded almost
as many times as he had been decorated. It was
impossible to get from him any account of his
adventures in the present campaign, but I gathered
from what his brother officers told me that he had
<a class="pagenum" name="page_245" title="245"> </a>
behaved with extraordinary gallantry at Charleroi,
and fell riddled with bullets when leading the last
remnant of his regiment in a counter-attack to save
the rest of the Brigade. He had been hit in the
leg, his right arm, pierced by a bullet, was withered
and useless, and three other bullet-holes in different
parts of his body brought to fifteen the total
number of wounds received during his military
career. His wonderful cheerfulness was an example
and a consolation to us all. I remember
when we were all discussing how long the war
would last&mdash;this problem was always a subject
of speculation and conversation&mdash;Colonel Lepeltier
declared that no one should give any thought to
themselves, or worry about the probable length of
their imprisonment. "I don't care," said he, "if
we are here for seven years. J'ai confiance dans
la France. La France triomphera et tout le reste
m'est egal." The doctor was quite remarkably
like the white rabbit in 'Alice in Wonderland,'
plump, short, blonde, closely-cropped hair, a tiny
moustache, an apologetic air, and an aggravating
habit of continually saying, "Ah, pardon." At
10 o'clock M.&nbsp;l'Abbé, who was the last up, put
out the lamps on the table. Candles were blown
out one by one until the only light left was that of
a single candle by the bedside of a young cavalry
officer who spent most of his time reading in spite
of the continual noise. To keep a candle alight
<a class="pagenum" name="page_246" title="246"> </a>
after "lights out" was an offence which, in our
room, met with instant punishment. "Rosteau,
Rosteau!" some one shouted, and I never knew if
this was a slang word of warning, but it was always
followed, as in this instance, by a whizzing boot
hurled at the offender's head. This was the signal
for the despatch of projectiles of all kinds,&mdash;tin
boxes with a bit of coal inside hurtled across the
room and fell on or by the enemy with a deafening
crash, hair-brushes, slippers, stale rolls of bread,
were flying in the dark from one side of the room
to the other. The performance was generally closed
by Colonel Lepeltier, whose orders for silence were
always instantly obeyed. To break the silence of
the night was against the unwritten law, except
for one purpose&mdash;to stop snoring. Here it was
Granny that was the chief offender. In spite of
the hardness of my bed, and the impossibility of
turning round without falling out, I think that
I might have got some sleep if it had not been
for Granny&mdash;a most kindly, lovable man by day,
but an aggressive, vulgar fellow at night, for whose
blood I have often thirsted in the early hours of
the morning. The usual method for stopping
snoring was to whistle loudly. If this did not
produce the desired effect, a clever shot with a boot
was sure to be successful in rousing not only the
snorer but the whole room.</p>

<p>Shortly after six o'clock the day began with the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_247" title="247"> </a>
entry of our French orderly&mdash;we had one to each
room&mdash;with the morning ration of bread on a large
tray: two small rolls to each man. After the rolls
had been distributed round the five rooms, the cups
of coffee, tea, or milk were brought along in the
same way. This was breakfast. I tried the coffee
one morning, found the tea just as bad, and finally
settled down to hot milk. Getting up was of
necessity regulated by the fact that we only possessed
two washhand-stands among ten people.
With washing, dressing, and shaving, I generally
managed to spin the time out to about 10 o'clock,
at which hour I used to take up quarters in
the English Club for the rest of the day. The
room which my English comrades occupied possessed
many advantages over my own: it was far
larger, and owing to the presence of a strong
fresh-air party, the windows were kept open continually.
In my room, where the stove was always
at a white heat, fresh air was looked upon
with disfavour; the windows were opened a few
inches while the room was being dusted, or when
tobacco smoke was too thick, and I, as a lover of
fresh air, was in a minority of one. In "53" room
the partisans of fresh air included not only the
three Englishmen but the senior and more assertive
of the French officers. In spite of the unanimity
which reigned in room "53" on this debatable
subject of windows open or windows shut, party
<a class="pagenum" name="page_248" title="248"> </a>
strife was nevertheless very much in evidence, and
centred chiefly round the question of noise. The room
was divided into as many sections of opinion as the
French Chamber of Deputies. Five officers hailing
from or about Marseilles, who lived in a row at the
far end of the room, represented the ultra Radicals.
They declared for the unlimited freedom of man,
and elected to make as much noise as suited them
at all times of the day or night. O&mdash;&mdash; belonged
to a party by himself. He was to sing and whistle
whenever the spirit moved, but when he engaged in
writing and reading, as fortunately was often the
case, the rest of the world was not expected to
interrupt. The English party, openly setting its
face against noise of any kind at all times, was
supported somewhat weakly by two or three adherents
who were not strong-minded enough to
accept the whole of our Party Policy, and were inclined
to advise moderation in all things. Our political
opponents&mdash;the Meridional ultra Radicals&mdash;were
known as the Gollywog, the Calendar, the Owl,
the Pup, and Consul. The Owl and the Calendar
(so called because he only shaved on Sundays, and
the day of the week could therefore be known from
the colour of his chin) were comparatively silent
partners to the conspiracy of noise, but the Gollywog,
Consul, and Pup made up amply for their
deficiencies. Their favourite occupation consisted
of inane discussion shouted across the room. "Et
<a class="pagenum" name="page_249" title="249"> </a>
autrem<i>ain</i> je dis que dans le service il faut tutoyer
les hommes. J'ai trente-cinq ans et je sais ce que
dis." "Eh! mon bon." This to the protesting Pup.
"Vous n'avez pas le droit de parler, vous êtes jeune,
vous sortez de l'&oelig;uf, vous sortez de l'&oelig;uf." This
expression of contempt for the youth of the Pup was
always the last word of the Gollywog, who would
strut up and down the room shouting, "Maintenant
vous n'avez rien à dire, vous sortez de l'&oelig;uf,
vous sortez de l'&oelig;uf." Consul, so called chiefly on
account of his agility and quickness of movement,
famous also for an entirely original method of
consuming bread and cheese, took part in noise
along with the others of his party more often in
chorus than in solo, but none of them except the
Gollywog had any idea what a nuisance they were
to the whole room.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>At 10.30, in answer to a great shouting of
"Promenade, Promenade" from room to room,
those who wished to go for a walk in the
"garden" assembled together at the end of the
corridor. The garden entrance was at the far
end of the courtyard, and in spite of the moat
and the triple lines of battlement, the promenading
party always crossed the court under escort.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_250" title="250"> </a>
It took me about five minutes to cross the yard.
Irvine and Reddy always stayed behind to help
me along. We were never allowed to start without
an extra guard, sometimes two or three, but
generally one soldier, rifle loaded and bayonet
fixed. Our sentry must have felt, and certainly
looked, extremely ridiculous escorting a cripple
at the rate of seventy yards in five minutes.
What we used to call the garden, Baedeker
briefly refers to as follows: "Visitors are admitted
to the terrace (view of town) on application to the
sentry (fee)." The terrace extended about a
hundred yards in length between the barrack
buildings and the moat. The total breadth is
not more than about fifteen feet. Most of the
space is taken up with flowerless flower-beds,
extending the whole length of the terrace, with
a double row of vines. A narrow pathway about
four feet broad was all the space available for
exercise. Doubtless the view from the terrace is
very fine, and perhaps worth a "fee to sentry,"
but we were very tired of it. On the right,
across the valley at the highest point of the
wooded hill, stands the Frankenwarte&mdash;a hideously
ugly watch-tower; lower down, about half-way
to the river, the "Kapelle," a pilgrimage chapel,
looked after by religious, whom we could sometimes
see walking about their garden, black dots
on the far hillside. The Ludwigsbrücke crosses
<a class="pagenum" name="page_251" title="251"> </a>
the Main far away below, and twice a week at
the same hour we used to watch a regiment of
infantry cross the bridge, and the strains of the
"Wacht am Rhein" could faintly reach our ears
when the wind was favourable. A group of
factories form an ugly background to the whole
picture, but we found in them a cause for rejoicing,
the tall smokeless chimneys bearing witness
to the stoppage of work and to the power of
Britain's fleet. Three sentries were always on
guard during our daily walk, one at each end of
the garden and one in the middle, although the
only means of exit was to drop down a precipice.
The wall on the moat-side bore an interesting
inscription to the memory of four French soldiers
who had fallen at the spot when the castle was
stormed in 1796.<a name="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> A number of cannon-balls,
half embedded high up in the masonry of the
barrack buildings, testify to the inefficiency of
artillery in the days when our great-grandfathers
were at war. There was one feature
about our terrace promenade which attracted
more attention from the promenaders than the
view over the town or the fresh air from the
hills. I cannot give a fair picture of the Festung
without referring to it and to some unpleasant
<a class="pagenum" name="page_252" title="252"> </a>
details which the fastidious reader may like to
skip. In the very centre of the terrace, hard
up against the path, is a large cesspool covered
over with two very badly fitting iron lids. The
sanitary arrangements for the whole fortress&mdash;that
is to say, prisoners and guard&mdash;are contained
in a wooden shed, which stands in the
centre of the courtyard just opposite the windows
of our corridor. Alongside this shed is another
cesspool, fortunately properly closed in. This
cesspool is emptied once a week or once a fortnight
into an <i>open cart</i>, which then proceeds to
our garden to be emptied. This process goes on
the whole morning. On this day it is impossible
to keep the windows open in the corridor, and
a visit to the terrace is, of course, out of the
question. Even on the next day the air is most
unpleasant, and if there is any rain the cesspool
in the garden overflows, and the narrow path
is turned into a stream of sewage.</p>

<p>As the castle clock strikes eleven, the terrace
party are marched back across the courtyard by
a strong guard, and I follow slowly in rear, with
a sentry all to myself, dodging manure-heaps and
tacking to avoid pools of dirty water and tracts
of nameless mud, so that my snail-like progress
causes no little worry to the attentive sentry. I
spoke to the doctor one day of the absurdity of
not allowing me to crawl across the yard without a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_253" title="253"> </a>
soldier with bayonet fixed, but the doctor rather had
the better of me, for, said he, "The sentry is not
provided as an escort, but as a guard of honour!"</p>

<p>Opposite the old doorway entrance leading up
to our cold corridor there is another door with
a stair leading up to some rooms which are occupied
by the permanent staff of the fortress,
perhaps by the men who, in times of peace,
collected fees from visitors to the castle. In the
morning, on our way out, the window above the
doorway was always filled with three smiling
baby faces, and on a fine day two of the children
always took their stand outside the door. Francie
was the name of the eldest little girl. She was
not more than eight years old; she wore a neat
little blue frock; her hair was of beautiful fairness.
She was a great friend of Reddy, and
always answered his "Guten Morgen, Francie,"
with smiling shyness. The fat baby, not very
clean, with tousled, flaxen curls, could only just
walk, and held nervously on to his sister's little
finger. Francie at first was very frightened at
my appearance, hobbling along on crutches, and
the poor little baby fell right over and began to
howl right lustily. But Francie soon got to know
me nearly as well as Reddy, and her pretty smile
was the brightest thing in the whole of Festung
Marienberg.</p>

<p>The midday meal was at 12.30. Brown bread,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_254" title="254"> </a>
ground-nut butter, and Gruyère cheese were extras
that could be ordered at every meal; and the
French orderly, when he came in to lay the table,
was greeted with cries from all in the room, each
officer shouting out for what he required. "20&nbsp;pf.
de beurre" brought a small pat of quite edible
butter, 25&nbsp;pf. was the price of a fairly large-sized
helping of brown bread, and 10&nbsp;pf. for a thin
slice of cheese. Cheese and butter were expensive
items, as by the time all the thumb-marks had
been scraped off, the ration was much reduced in
size. The soup was doled out in the kitchen,
which, I have forgotten to mention, was at the
end of the corridor and the door guarded by a
sentry. The loaded soup plates were brought in
on a large tray carried by two orderlies. The
plates were generally full to the brim, and the
orderly would seize one plate in each hand, planting
a large and very black thumb right into the
swirling soup. Waves of soup then splashed on
to the floor or disappeared up a dirty sleeve. I
never ate soup while at Würzburg, and even now
seldom do so without thinking of the black thumb.
The next and final course came in on the trays
as before, and was served on oblong plates divided
up into four square compartments&mdash;meat in one
corner, potatoes in the second, and sauerkraut in
the third, the fourth being left to eat out of. A
knife and fork was provided for each officer, who
<a class="pagenum" name="page_255" title="255"> </a>
had, however, to buy his own glass; and in our
room, by very special favour, we had been allowed
to buy a coloured cotton table-cloth. It was very
seldom that any satisfaction could be got out of
the meat course, which was almost always pork
in some shape or form, and the mainstay of every
repast was provided from our private stores of
cream, cheese, honey, and brown bread. Supper
was, as I have said, merely a slice of cold ham
or a sausage and potatoes. The "Gehaltsabrechnung"
for this not very luxurious fare was 31&nbsp;m.
70&nbsp;pf. per month. Officers of the rank of lieutenant
were paid 60&nbsp;m. a month, from which a
deduction was made for board.</p>

<p>We were allowed to see two German papers&mdash;the
'Kölnische Zeitung' and the 'Lokal Würzburger
Anzeiger.' These papers arrived after lunch,
and anything of interest was translated aloud for
the benefit of the club by Reddy, who knew German
thoroughly. The former showed a disposition
to break forth into sensational headlines, and was
rabidly and sometimes comically anti-English. On
the occasion of the Heligoland fight, one paper
announced in large print that the British battle-cruiser
<i>Lion</i> had been sunk. In next day's paper
we discovered, hidden away in a corner, the statement
that the <i>Lion</i>, crippled beyond repair, had
been towed into port, and that the <i>Blücher</i>, owing
to an accident in the engine-room, had unfortunately
<a class="pagenum" name="page_256" title="256"> </a>
sunk on her way back to harbour. News
from the British front was not often given much
space, and it was easy to guess that at the time
there was nothing much doing in that direction.
The news from Soissons was naturally made the
most of, and was very disheartening reading.</p>

<p>I remember how amused we were at the account
of a coal strike in Yorkshire. This, we were all
convinced, was an ingenious German lie. Much
as we used to long to see English newspapers, I am
now thankful that we were not allowed to see them,
and that my fellow-prisoners are still confined to
sceptical reading of the 'Kölnische Zeitung' and
can enjoy undisturbed their own imaginary picture
of Britain at war, which a knowledge of the truth
would quickly dispel. The long dull days of life
at the Festung Marienberg recall a memory of
much yearning for news of England, of speculation
as to the date of our liberation, and above
all, of an intense desire to witness some day the
defeat and humiliation of our insolent enemy. But
the misery of inactivity when so much is needed
to be done, the monotony, the aimless futility of
existence that is no longer useful, this is the real
trial which makes imprisonment intolerable. There
are few prisoners in the Festung Marienberg who
would not joyfully exchange their lot for that of
a Welsh miner, and work till they dropped for
enough bread to keep body and soul together.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_257" title="257"> </a>
The mental sufferings of those who are imprisoned
in Germany is intensified by the fear that others
who have not learnt the truth from bitter experience
will not believe. We, in the fortress, knew the
power of Germany&mdash;could feel it in every incident
of our lives. We lived in the very midst of an
organisation which moves as one for one purpose&mdash;the
destruction of European civilisation and the
substitution of Teutonic conceptions. The truth
which years before had sounded incredible, when
voiced by the authority of Lord Roberts, and had
been dismissed by the majority of the nation as
the senile vapourings of a decrepit Jingo, this
truth was now as familiar to us in the Festung
as the air we breathed.</p>

<p>What if the nation still fails to understand? If
a message could come from our imprisoned countrymen
in Germany, from our long-suffering allies in
Belgium, whose integrity we guaranteed by a solemn
promise which we made no arrangements to keep,
from all who know by hard experience how Germany
treats those whom she has conquered, such
a message would declare that no sacrifice can be
too great provided the military domination of
Prussia is finally destroyed. Those who have
felt the power of the enemy know also that if we
are to be successful nothing less than the maximum
effort is demanded. What this means Britain as
yet does not begin to understand.</p>

IV.<br />

<span class="small">EXTRACTS FROM MY DIARY, EXPANDED AND
EXPLAINED.</span></h3>

<p>"<i>Sunday, Jan. 10th.</i>&mdash;Mass, 8.30. Snowed a
little."</p>

<p>M.&nbsp;l'Abbé officiated. Very nearly all the French
officers attended Mass. From my room two were
either too ill or too lazy, and Granny, who, in the
early hours of the morning, was frightened of catching
cold, did not appear outside the bedclothes.
The officer who used to read at night, at whom
boots were thrown every evening on the stroke of
ten, declared himself to be a Pagan, and so he also
remained in bed. The choir loft of the chapel had
been set aside for the use of the prisoners, and
thither we were escorted down a dark stair and
long corridor by the usual armed sentries, one of
whom remained with us in the church. The body
of the church was filled with German soldiers.
During Mass the organ was played and hymns were
sung by the German part of the congregation.
After Mass was Benediction, when it was our
privilege to sing. Colonel Lepeltier, with a very
powerful voice, acted as leader of the choir, the
Frenchmen singing with great <i>entrain</i>, as if to let
the enemy know they were not downhearted. On
<a class="pagenum" name="page_259" title="259"> </a>
this Sunday M.&nbsp;l'Abbé preached a short sermon
on the gospel of the day, but this privilege, no
doubt displeasing to the lower part of the congregation,
was afterwards withdrawn, and on the
following Sundays we had to endure a discourse
from a German priest.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>Monday, Jan. 11th.</i>&mdash;Snow. A sentry committed
suicide last night in the corridor. Great excitement
among the Germans."</p>

<p>It was very early on Monday morning, long
before daylight, that a noise of running feet outside
the door of our room showed that something
abnormal had happened.</p>

<p>Colonel Lepeltier ordered every one to stay in
their beds, and we speculated vainly as to the
cause of the uproar until the orderly came in with
"Breakfast." A sentry had shot himself through
the head, and was lying where he had fallen at
the far end of the corridor, guarded himself now,
poor fellow, by a brother sentry. No one was
allowed out of his room until the corpse had
been removed, which was not done until several
officials had inspected the remains. When the
inquest was over and the corridor cleaned up, a
stain on the stone floor and a bullet-hole in the
wall remained to tell the tragic story. Snow
was falling that afternoon, and there was no
chance of getting out to the terrace, so that the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_260" title="260"> </a>
rest of the day had to be devoted to Poker and
Bridge, games of which all were heartily sick.
Reading was difficult on account of the ceaseless
noise kept up by Gollywog and his merry men.
Our game of Bridge was played at the end of the
dining-table, the other end being occupied by chess,
of which the Gollywog and Consul were the chief
exponents. In the hands of these experts chess
became the noisiest of all parlour games. They
played on the co-operative system, two players
sitting at the board, the others standing up at each
side of the table. No piece was moved without
great discussion, conducted in a loud voice, with
much gesture. As soon as a piece had been moved
the chess-board became a sort of storm centre into
which even non-players seated at the far end of the
room would recklessly plunge.</p>

<p>As a result of one of these discussions two of our
southern friends quarrelled in real earnest, and
most dramatically vowed to fight a duel at the
close of the war. Reddy suggested it was a pity
to put off the encounter indefinitely, and meantime
proposed the use of coal buckets at fifteen
paces. Strangely enough this real quarrel brought
peace to the room for a few minutes, but the parties
soon made friends again and the noise went on
with renewed vigour. At seven o'clock the table
was cleared and laid for dinner.</p>

<p>Dinner as usual, cabbage and cold sausage, the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_261" title="261"> </a>
latter somewhat more palatable when fried on the
stove to black crusty cinders.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>Tuesday, Jan. 12th.</i>&mdash;Doctor's visit. I asked to
be exchanged. There seems to be some hope."</p>

<p>This first meeting with the doctor was to me a
cause of much apprehension. In the event of an
exchange of prisoners, it was in this man's hands
that the final decision would lie as to what prisoners
were unfit for military service.</p>

<p>Shortly after 11&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span> a French officer told me
that the doctor was visiting my room. The corridor
was very cold that morning, and, partly from the
cold, partly from nervousness, my entry into the
room where the doctor was waiting was most impressive.
For the moment I lost control of my
limbs, and nearly collapsed into the doctor's arms.</p>

<p>Dr Zinck is a small fair-haired man, about thirty
years of age. He speaks English with fluency,
having lived for some years in New York. He had
visited Scotland, and stayed, he said, at Skibo with
Andrew Carnegie. When no other German officer
was present his speech and manner with me was
always polite, sometimes verging on kindness.
Whilst I was resting on a chair he made an examination
of my head, and read the certificate which
Dr Debu had given me at Cambrai. This document,
I was glad to see, seemed to create a
favourable impression. He then asked me to try
<a class="pagenum" name="page_262" title="262"> </a>
and walk with one stick only. In attempting to
do this, which at times I was well able to do, my
right leg, fortunately, refused to move forward.
The doctor took down some notes in his book and
seemed to have quite made up his mind as to the
hopelessness of my condition. In answer to my
inquiry, "There will be no exchange of officers,"
he said, "and you will never get any better." The
latter part of this not very cheering remark was
fairly satisfactory, as it meant that if ever there
was to be an exchange, my name would be on
the list. The hardships at the Festung which I
felt most keenly were the hard straw bed and the
impossibility of getting the hot baths which at
Cambrai had afforded me so much relief. The
doctor offered to give me some morphia pills; but
these I refused to take, and asked to be given a
proper mattress, or to be allowed to buy one. On
a subsequent visit he informed me that this could
not be permitted, adding that he "dared not do
too much for the English." Such, to the best of
my remembrance, were the very words he used,
seeming genuinely ashamed at having to refuse
such a request.</p>

<p>When Dr Zinck paid me his next visit, he was
accompanied by the Rittmeister Niebuhr, the officer
in command of the fortress. It would be an unwarrantable
insult to the German army to say that
the Rittmeister was a typical German officer.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_263" title="263"> </a>
Medium height, sparely built, sallow complexion,
dark hair and moustache, with his burlesque
swagger and affectation of dignity and authority,
he was such a caricature of a German officer as
may be seen in a comic illustrated paper. Hatred
of the English and a bullying manner appeared
to be his chief qualifications as Fortress Commander.
A safe occupation this to worry defenceless
prisoners, and one more suited, perhaps, to
his capabilities and inclination than a soldier's
work at the Front. My first introduction to this
unpleasant individual was when the doctor brought
him to see me in answer to my request for hot
baths. I was lying in the English room on
the corner bed, known as the Club Sofa. I
struggled up into a sitting position, and saluted
the visitors to the best of my ability. The Rittmeister
did not deign to take the slightest notice.
Dr Zinck explained that I had asked for hot baths
three times a week, and requested permission to
hire a carriage down to the public baths. The
Rittmeister, with an insolence of manner worthy
of Hudson Lowe, told the doctor to say to "Dem
Mann" that the monthly bath, graciously allowed
to officers, according to the wise German regulations
posted up in every room, for the purpose
of personal cleanliness, quite sufficient was. During
the whole conversation I was continually
referred to as "Der Mann," which, according to
<a class="pagenum" name="page_264" title="264"> </a>
German etiquette, is, from one officer to another,
the height of insolence.</p>

<p>Once a month eight officers at a time were
allowed down to the public baths in the town.
Those who could walk were escorted down by half
a dozen guards, and the walk must have been a
welcome relief from the monotony of the fortress.
Later on, after I left, Reddy got leave to be taken
down to the dentist, and wrote to say how delightful
it was to be seated for a short time in an arm-chair.
It is not often that a dentist's chair is looked
upon with such favour. Those who could not walk
down to the town were driven in a sort of prison
van; most of the invalids were from my room&mdash;Colonel
Lepeltier, Granny, and three officers, who
were still very lame, one of whom has since been
exchanged. Irvine, who was not quite up to walking,
and myself, very nearly filled up the van.
After we had got in there was not much room
for the two sentries, who, like most of their kind,
needed a lot of accommodation. It was, however,
quite impossible to get the rifles in with the
bayonets fixed. After one or two attempts, and
after sticking the point of their bayonets nearly
through the roof of the van, they finally gave it
up, unfixed bayonets, and sat holding them in
their hands. The windows of our carriage were
of frosted glass, barred right along inside and out,
so that we could see nothing of the town as we
<a class="pagenum" name="page_265" title="265"> </a>
went along. A quarter of an hour's drive brought
us to our destination. The van turned into a large
covered yard, in one corner of which was a large
motor waggon and a pile of worn-out knapsacks,
boots, and military kit of various nature. From
this yard a flight of stone steps led down into a
basement where some men were making packing-cases.
A long corridor led to the bathing
establishment, which was very clean and tidy.
The accommodation was, however, limited&mdash;four
baths and four shower-baths. Irvine very kindly
helped me in and out of my bath and assisted
me to dress, the sentries meantime keeping a sharp
look-out outside my door. When we had finished,
the old woman in charge of the establishment came
round with Mr Poerringer, who had driven down
on the box-seat, and collected a mark from each
of us. As I was ready dressed before the rest of
the party had quite finished, I made a start down
the corridor, so as not to keep everybody waiting.
This was at once noticed by one of the sentries,
who zealously followed behind me; whereupon I
reduced my speed to the slowest possible crawl.</p>

<p>On our return journey one of the party produced
a flask of what is known in the fortress, and perhaps
elsewhere, as "Quetsch," a very fiery, sweet-tasting,
white liqueur. We all took a nip, and I
ventured to offer some to our melancholy guardians.
To attempt such familiarity was, of course, a serious
<a class="pagenum" name="page_266" title="266"> </a>
breach of regulations, and they shook their heads
regretfully. They were a most amusing-looking
pair, sitting very squeezed up, opposite each other,
in the corners nearest the door, each gripping
firmly to his bayonet, both of them short and
round and solemn, like Tweedledum and
Tweedledee.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>Jan. 15th.</i>&mdash;Inspection."&mdash;A general inspection
of the fortress was carried out every two or three
months. The inspection on this day&mdash;the only
one which took place while I was a prisoner&mdash;resulted
in my getting into trouble with the inspecting
officer, who, as I had been warned by
my fellow-prisoners, would be on the look-out for
any pretext to punish the English. I was sitting
at the dining-table in the English room, with
my back to the door, when the inspecting party
came suddenly in. I could not turn round to see,
and did not know who the noisy visitors were
until I saw that every one in the room was standing
to attention. I slowly rose from my chair and,
leaning both hands on the table, managed to keep
a fairly good balance, which I nearly lost in taking
my pipe out of my mouth. When the group,
which consisted of the Inspecting Colonel, the
Rittmeister, and Mr Poerringer, came opposite to
where I was standing, they stopped and looked at
me. "Who is that fellow?" said the Colonel.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_267" title="267"> </a>
"What is he doing here? He is surely not an
officer. He is not standing at attention, and has
only just deigned to remove a pipe from his mouth.
Has he been wounded?" "No," promptly responded
the Rittmeister, but Mr Poerringer stepped
forward and corrected him. They then passed
round the room and went out without further
observation. Five minutes later Mr Poerringer
came in and said that the Colonel wished to speak
to me in the corridor.</p>

<p>Outside the door was the inspecting officer&mdash;large,
not very tall, somewhat red in the face, no
doubt a pleasant enough man after his second
bottle of wine. I leant against the wall and
saluted by lowering my head on one side and endeavouring
in vain to raise the right arm to meet
it. Mr Poerringer and the Rittmeister stood
frozen to attention, whilst the Colonel delivered a
long statement to the former in order that he
might translate it for my benefit. I was being
severely reprimanded. Apparently the meanest
soldier in the German army was a better-mannered
man than I was. Of course, bad manners was
only what might be expected of a British officer.
If I did not know how to behave, they would soon
teach me, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Every word of this tirade,
most of which I understood, was then repeated
in French by Mr Poerringer, and his translation
was certainly milder than the original. The
<a class="pagenum" name="page_268" title="268"> </a>
Rittmeister stood by with an evil grin. When
they had all finished, I told Mr Poerringer that I
was physically incapable of showing such outward
signs of respect as were due the inspecting officer,
and that my failure to show him honour was not
due to any desire to be discourteous. My explanation
really seemed to me&mdash;unable as I was
even to stand without crutches&mdash;almost an insult
to such common-sense as a German officer might
be supposed to possess. My court-martial of three
then withdrew further up the corridor, consulted
together, and sent Mr Poerringer to me to say
that "in view of what I had said, the Colonel had
very kindly agreed to overlook my offence, and
therefore I would be let off the punishment of cells."</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>Jan. 16th.</i>&mdash;Hairdresser. The Rittmeister calls
again." Once a week came a gold-spectacled,
middle-aged hairdresser, accompanied always by
a sentry with the ever-loaded rifle and the everlastingly
fixed bayonet, who stood behind the chair
in which the officers took turns for a shave and
hair-cut.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we had another call from the
Rittmeister, whose visit this time was the most
exciting incident which took place during my stay
at the Fortress, and was for a long time the subject
of animated discussion in all the rooms. The
whole affair really began and ended with Gollywog.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_269" title="269"> </a>
Mr Poerringer came in about four o'clock and said
that the Rittmeister wished to speak to Lt. C&mdash;&mdash;.
Gollywog went out into the corridor, remained
absent for fully five minutes, and came back with
the Rittmeister, who advanced into the middle of
the room and ordered "All English officers to
leave the room." This was most interesting, and
the four of us went out into the corridor greatly
wondering what new game was being played.
After about a quarter of an hour the Rittmeister
came out and went off down the corridor, whereupon
we hastened back to hear what had happened.
The Rittmeister had made a most genial and polite
speech. He had heard that the English officers
had not been behaving properly, that they were
quarrelsome, disagreeable men, and so on, for a
good few minutes, ending up with a request that
the French officers would kindly come to him if
they had any complaint to make, however small,
concerning the conduct of the English, who would
then promptly be put in cells. "Bobjohn," a
Lieutenant de Reserve, who knew German very
well, replied briefly on behalf of the French
officers&mdash;that they were all, English and French,
brothers-in-arms and firm friends. The Rittmeister
then went off in a very bad temper,
disappointed that his clumsy plot to get the
English into trouble had been a total failure.
We were all indeed more amused at, than angry
<a class="pagenum" name="page_270" title="270"> </a>
with, the Rittmeister's impertinence, but many
of the French officers thought that Gollywog's
part in the affair was open to suspicion; in fact,
he was suspected of having complained to Mr
Poerringer. I think it, however, more likely that
the sentries, who were always spying and trying
to see what was going on in the room, had something
to do with it. Next morning I happened
to meet O&mdash;&mdash; in the corridor and immediately
started swearing at him in a loud voice. He
grasped the idea at once, and I could see the
nearest sentry watching us narrowly. Sham fights
between the French and English were started at
intervals during the day, with the door left wide
open so that the sentry could get a full view. In
my room great annoyance was expressed at the
whole affair, and Colonel Lepeltier declared that
the Gollywog's conduct was open to very grave
suspicion. As a matter of fact, hardly any of the
French officers were on speaking terms with the
Gollywog, and so this rather unpleasant incident
did not make any difference to his relations with
his fellow-prisoners.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>"Send me a post-card when you have time,"
writes a friend from Germany; "letters and post-cards
are the only things we live for." And so it
<a class="pagenum" name="page_271" title="271"> </a>
was at the Festung Marienberg. Two or three
times a week Mr Poerringer would come in with
a bundle of letters and call out the names of the
lucky ones, the officers all crowding round with
eager faces, listening, waiting, hoping. Two
officers only sat apart and watched, not without
envy. One, a Frenchman from Lille, could never
hope to hear from his wife or family, as communication
with invaded territory is not permitted.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival at Würzburg I wrote
three letters&mdash;one letter home, one to X.Y.Z., one to
the American Ambassador in Berlin. At that time
there was no restriction as to number, although
later not more than one letter a week was allowed.
I could not hope for news from home till the end
of February, as six weeks was generally the time
which elapsed before an answer came from England.
Irvine told me that on arriving at Würzburg
he had written informing the American Embassy
at Berlin of his position, and that in reply the
Ambassador expressed a wish for information concerning
the whereabouts of British officers. I
therefore wrote to the Embassy stating the fact
of my arrival at Würzburg, explaining the nature
of my wounds, enclosing a copy of the certificate
from Dr Debu also&mdash;and this was the part I
feared might not pass the Censor&mdash;asking the
Ambassador to put my case before the German
authorities at Berlin.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_272" title="272"> </a>
By the same post I wrote to X.Y.Z., whose
letter to Captain S&mdash;&mdash; had so providentially fallen
into my hands at Cambrai. In this letter I gave
a list&mdash;in answer to her inquiry&mdash;of all officers and
men of whom any information had reached me at
Cambrai. I also drew a pathetic picture of my
own situation, enclosing a copy of the much-copied
medical certificate, and begging X.Y.Z. to use
influence on my behalf.</p>

<p>While at Cambrai and Würzburg two questions
were constantly in my mind&mdash;first, Would there
be an exchange of officers? second, If there was
to be an exchange, how was I to make sure that
my case would not be forgotten?</p>

<p>Pope Benedict&nbsp;XV., although I knew it not, was
working hard to obtain a satisfactory reply to the
first question. The happy solution of the second
must depend on my two letters to Berlin and on
the wide circulation of my medical certificate.</p>

<p>This certificate was a most alarming piece of
evidence as to my condition, and I am glad to say
that the event has so far proved the medical
diagnosis to be a pessimistic one.</p>

<p>Medical men have told me that in nine cases
out of ten such injury as is mentioned in this
certificate results in the inconvenient habit of a
spasmodic falling on to the floor, attended with
foaming at the mouth and other unpleasant
symptoms, all of which are included under the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_273" title="273"> </a>
mysterious title "Jacksonian epilepsis." On account
of this medical certificate, which more than
hinted at the probability of my acquiring such
unpleasant accomplishments, I was known to my
friends in the fortress as "Jackson."</p>

<p>My two letters had been sent off on the 10th of
January. Mr Poerringer very kindly gave me this
information, he himself being the Censor. On the
26th January my first letter arrived, the first letter
since my leaving England six months ago. It was
from the American Embassy. Reading my name
and address on the envelope, I began to feel a
"person" again. The world outside the fortress
was more real to me from that moment than it
had been for many months. The letter dated
21st January acknowledged receipt of my communication
of 9th January, and regretted to inform
me "that the question of exchange had not yet
become an actual fact, and that the exact provisions
whereby exchanges, when actually effected, will be
governed have not yet been determined.... As
regards the approximate date in the future at
which the exchange of wounded prisoners will take
place, the Embassy regrets to be unable to give
you information. Negotiations are on the way,
but no definite agreement has yet been reached."
During that afternoon my letter was a subject of
much argument. Never did I dare allow myself to
read into these sentences any hope of freedom.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_274" title="274"> </a>
It is better for a prisoner to live with no prospect
of release than to hope vainly and be disappointed.
So the letter was put away and kept out of mind
as far as was possible.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards I happened to meet Mr
Poerringer in the corridor. He bade me good
morning with even more than his usual kindness,
and produced a letter. This was from X.Y.Z.,
and reading this letter over now, it seems hard
to believe that when I read it in the fortress I
dared not find in it any hope or any reasonable
ground for hope. "I will certainly do my very
best," says the letter, "to get you included among
those for exchange. I gave your medical report
to the American Consul, ... and he has promised
to go into the whole matter thoroughly with the
authorities. The matter of exchange will take
some time to arrange, I believe, so don't be too
disappointed if you don't hear something at
once." Here, at any rate, was the definite statement
that there was to be an exchange, yet it
was still a struggle in my own mind between
hope, and fear that dared not hope, and fear was
still the conqueror. Mr Poerringer came into our
room with some papers very shortly afterwards,
and I asked him if it would be any use asking
for an interview with the officer commanding
at Würzburg. Mr Poerringer's reply roused the
whole room to attention: "Vous allez probablement
<a class="pagenum" name="page_275" title="275"> </a>
aller en Angleterre." Nothing more would
he say, except that a letter had arrived about me
from the War Minister. All my friends crowded
round to discuss whether any credence might be
placed in Mr Poerringer's information, and the
verdict was that it would not be safe to take
him at his word. Little belief existed among my
fellow-prisoners, even after Mr Poerringer's statement,
of the possibility of any exchange taking
place. The odds laid during my first week at the
Fortress against my being exchanged were 20 to 1.
That evening, in spite of all the favourable signs,
odds of 10 to 1 against were offered and taken.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Life in the Festung was becoming very hard.
Snow had fallen heavily. For several days, owing
to alternate frost and snow, the courtyard,
whether a mass of slippery ice or of penetrating
melting snow, was now a barrier to the garden,
across which I dared not venture. The corridor
was so intensely cold that it was no place for me
to take exercise in. My only relief at this time
from lying on a bed was to take a few turns up
and down the room during the hour of the
promenade, when all windows were wide open.
Every inch of the picture as seen from those
<a class="pagenum" name="page_276" title="276"> </a>
windows is familiar to me. Far away, beyond
the low vine-covered hills, now deep in snow,
the spruce woods stand out pitch-black on the
all-white horizon. More distinct than usual in
the snow were the quaintly-shaped roofs of ancient
houses and the numerous steeples and church
towers for which Würzburg is celebrated in guide-books.
Traffic on the river had ceased, for the
big, broad barges were ice-bound, and only in
the centre of the stream the yellow water ran
freely, hustling along great lumps of ice and
melting snow. Over the bridge ran the electric
tram lines that connect the town with the large
suburbs on our side of the river, and the cold
air&mdash;it was now freezing very hard&mdash;carried with
distinctness the clanging, whining sound of the
passing trams.</p>

<p>Wooden huts, surrounded with a high paling,
lay right below, but the distance was just too
great to enable us to see if they were inhabited
by French or English prisoners. Away beyond
the huts were large stone and brick barracks,
from where on Sundays a band was wont to
come forth and march close up to the fortress,&mdash;a
real German band this, they played extremely
badly.</p>

<p>During the time of the hard frost a field close
by the barracks had been flooded and turned into
a skating-rink, where all day long the skaters,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_277" title="277"> </a>
black dots in the distance, circled round on the
white board.</p>

<p>The steep avenue leading down from the fortress
through the wooded slope was at this time an
object of interest. A number of small boys were
enjoying themselves tobogganing down the rough
uneven surface, running races, upsetting and rolling
down the slope head over heels in the snow,
with cries of joy and laughter. Some forty feet
below the window, along the parapet of the inner
battlement, two sentries stamping out a path on
the snow looked up from time to time with
suspicion at the figure leaning out of the prison
window. Night was falling. The two sentries
were impatiently waiting to be relieved. At last
the relieving party appeared, escorted by a corporal;
with due ceremony the guard was changed
and the new sentries began their dreary tramp
with rifle slung over their shoulders, beating
hands and stamping feet against the ever-increasing
cold.</p>

<p>Large electric arc-lamps had recently been fixed
outside the windows, so that a strong light was
thrown on the parapet and wall below, and the
sentry could see to shoot any one, utterly foolish,
who should attempt to climb down from our
window to the parapet&mdash;a place, even when
safely reached, from which there was no possibility
of further escape. Electric light is used
<a class="pagenum" name="page_278" title="278"> </a>
most lavishly by the town of Würzburg, and the
effect of the twinkling lights of the city, seen
from the fortress, is very beautiful, but one must
be in the right mood to appreciate such things.</p>

<p>"Shut the window, Jackson, and let's have a
game of poker." This was the voice of "Bobjohn"&mdash;the
best of friends. I have said too
little of these friends of mine&mdash;both French and
English&mdash;too little of their kindness, patience, and
unselfishness with one who was often irritable and
unreasonable.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>28th.</i> Zeppelin. A great rush for the windows."&mdash;I
did not realise before how tremendously big
these Zeppelins are. It was a grand sight to see
the grey-white ship, big as an Atlantic liner, sailing
over the river, and to see it turn and come
straight towards the castle on a level with our
windows. When only some few hundred yards
away, so near that we could see the features of the
men in the passenger car, the ship turned again
and circled round the fortress, and from the windows
of the corridor we watched it disappearing
into the sunlight over the distant hills.</p>

<p>This evening was marked by the arrival of a
parcel of books, Tauchnitz edition, which we had
been allowed to order. No doubt the publishers
are glad of the chance to unload their stock of
British authors, as, after the war is over, there
<a class="pagenum" name="page_279" title="279"> </a>
will not be much demand for the Tauchnitz
volumes.</p>

<p>Early in February another guest arrived at the
fortress&mdash;another member for the English club.
This was Foljambe, from L'Hôpital Notre Dame,
Cambrai, who had made a very good recovery from
severe wounds. Our new comrade, still very weak,
only able to walk a short distance, arrived late in
the afternoon, and was allotted a bed in my room.
His experiences on the journey from Cambrai were
very similar to mine. Although I have little direct
evidence of how the Germans treat our soldiers, the
information which Foljambe gave me on the subject
is conclusive.</p>

<p>Foljambe, before coming up to the fortress, was
put by mistake and left for nearly an hour in a
soldier's Lager on the outskirts of Würzburg, and
his story confirmed what the French orderlies had
told us about the ill-treatment of the English
soldiers.</p>

<p>"The English soldiers," said Foljambe, "go
about like whipped dogs." Most of them were
ill from want of food and warm clothing. Any
excuse was seized upon to inflict hard punishments,
and the constant bullying which was permitted,
if not actually ordered by the officer in
charge, made the men's life a perpetual torment.
Foljambe had no time to get many details from
the men, as the Germans hastily removed him
<a class="pagenum" name="page_280" title="280"> </a>
from their company as soon as they found out
that he was an officer.</p>

<p>On the field of battle no danger could silence the
cheerful jest of these brave men; in hospital no
suffering had been able to damp their cheery
courage. The picture of these same soldiers cringing,
looking from left to right when spoken to, as if
to avoid a blow, is one upon which I cannot allow
my thoughts to dwell.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>Feb. 11th.</i>&mdash;Nothing to record." This is the
last entry in my diary. The doctor came again
with the Rittmeister, and spent a long time by the
bedside of Lieut. C&mdash;&mdash;, who had been shot through
the sciatic nerve, and was apparently permanently
lame. They left the room without taking any
notice of me. This was depressing.</p>

<p>It was understood that C&mdash;&mdash;'s case for exchange
was being considered. Dr Zinck had taken no
notice of me on this occasion, probably because my
case had already been decided; but this view did
not occur to me at the time. A rumour had been
going round the rooms that an exchange of French
officers, but not of English, would shortly take
place.</p>

<p>The afternoon, my last in the fortress, passed
slowly and sadly, like so many others. Poker had
long ago been abandoned. Bridge was played with
small enthusiasm.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_281" title="281"> </a>
A visit to the big room near the end of the
corridor helped to pass away the evening. Here
Captain D&mdash;&mdash;, owner of some big mills in the
north of France, showed me a working model loom
which he had made out of firewood with no other
tools than a penknife. With the loom he was
weaving a "carpet" the size of a small pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Feb. 12th</i>&mdash;<i>Der Tag.</i>&mdash;At 9&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span> I was shaving at
the toilet-table in the window recess when Dr Zinck
came into the room alone, which was unusual. He
walked over to where I was sitting, and the following
was our brief but exciting conversation&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are happy now."</p>

<p>"Why should I be happy this morning," said I,
"more than any other morning?"</p>

<p>"But don't you know? You are going back to
England."</p>

<p>Then for one brief moment I believed, but yet
tried to keep from showing my joy, lest perhaps
the news were false.</p>

<p>The doctor walked up and down the room in
silence, then turned to me with a worried look.
"Don't say anything about what I have told you.
You and C&mdash;&mdash; are going away, but I should not
have told you. I did not know you had not been
told." And then he left the room.</p>

<p>Some one announced that the van in which we
<a class="pagenum" name="page_282" title="282"> </a>
used to go down to the baths had arrived in the
yard, presumably to take me away. On going into
the corridor to see this welcome sight I met Reddy
and Irvine hurrying to hear the news, which, of
course, had at once been spread throughout the
Fortress. We were standing in the corridor talking,
when Dr Zinck ran up. "<i>Nix, nix</i>," he said,
with his Bavarian accent, "there will be no
exchange with England, on account of the submarine
blockade. A telegram has come from
Berlin. You are not going away."</p>

<p>Hope and despair now fought confusedly; where
was the truth? Colonel Lepeltier comforted me
with his assurance that the doctor's last statement
was a lie; that Dr Zinck had become frightened
lest the Rittmeister would be angry at my having
been told the good news too soon.</p>

<p>Certainly the van was still in the yard, the horses
had been unyoked. There might be hope after all.
I went as usual to room "53," lay down on the
corner bed&mdash;the Club sofa&mdash;for the last time took
up the book I had been reading the day before,
found my place&mdash;the last chapter of 'David
Copperfield.'</p>

<p>I had reached and nearly finished the last page,
when the door was flung open and the Rittmeister
entered in the well-known manner, suddenly, and
with a quick look round the room, as if hoping to
catch somebody up to mischief.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_283" title="283"> </a>
As soon as he came into the room I knew instinctively
what he had come for: while trying to get off
the bed to salute I heard the much-longed-for word
"Austausch." "You must leave at once," he said&mdash;"at
once."</p>

<p>Reddy helped me off the bed and down the
corridor, to say good-bye to my friends and get
my luggage.</p>

<p>Mr Poerringer and the Rittmeister followed
behind, the latter, as Reddy remarked, eyeing me
narrowly. I took longer than usual in this last
walk down the corridor.</p>

<p>The Rittmeister followed into the room, went
over to C&mdash;&mdash;, and told him he was to leave next
morning, then walked round the table past the
bed where I was sitting, and left the room without
further sign or word. I said good-bye to Colonel
Lepeltier and my new friends, and as it was midday
Mr Poerringer suggested that I should stop for
a few minutes in room "53" to get some lunch.</p>

<p>The meat course on that day was a dish of tripe
which few of us could face, and while I was eating
my bread and cheese Reddy made up a parcel of
bread and Leberwurst for me to take along.</p>

<p>Mr Poerringer stood by the window watching,
orders having been given that I was not to be
left alone.</p>

<p>When Mr Poerringer remarked casually that
the train left in half an hour, and that if I missed
<a class="pagenum" name="page_284" title="284"> </a>
it there would be no other, I did not wait to finish
the bread and cheese.</p>

<p>Reddy put the parcel of food into one pocket of
my greatcoat, a small bottle of beer in the other,
and I bade adieu to my friends, feeling quite ashamed
of and yet unable to hide the joy of my going.</p>

<p>Reddy for the last time helped me down the stairs
and into the van. Mr Poerringer got in beside me.</p>

<p>I said good-bye to Reddy, and for a moment
felt miserable at leaving so kind a friend to endless
days of a misery from which I was now free.</p>

<p>As the van moved off he waved his hand with
a cheery smile, and then turned away up the
spiral staircase.</p>

<p>Mr Poerringer sat silent in a corner of the
carriage (the same vehicle in which we had gone
down to the baths). We crossed the courtyard,
passed the entrance to the terrace, the sentries
guarding the bridge over the moat. We entered
the tunnelled archway, went slowly down the steep
hill, and drove through the last barrier. These
things I could see, for the window was open.</p>

<p>My thought was still struggling with the realisation
of what these things meant, and of what lay
beyond these prison walls, when, as we drove into
the main road, Mr Poerringer broke the silence,
and there was a tinge of envy in his voice, "La
guerre est fini pour vous," he said, "La guerre est
fini pour vous."</p>

CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="small">WÜRZBURG TO ENGLAND.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent" >"La guerre est fini pour vous."</p>

<p>The van drove slowly down the road which runs
along the outer fortification of the Castle. Mr
Poerringer did not speak again, and I was silently
trying to grasp the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>We stopped at the hut hospital barracks where
I had been taken on my arrival at Würzburg five
weeks before. Mr Poerringer got out and saluted
Doctor Zinck, who was waiting outside the gates.
The Doctor caught my eye and grinned from ear
to ear, behind the back of some other officers;
probably he would have spoken to me had it not
been for their presence. I smiled at him rather
feebly. At this time my mind contained but one
idea&mdash;the fear that something would occur to prevent
my departure from Würzburg. I was frightened
to speak lest some word of mine might be
made an excuse for detention. The four British
<a class="pagenum" name="page_286" title="286"> </a>
soldiers who now got into the van were evidently
in a similar state of mind. Two of them had
travelled with me from Cambrai. We none of
us spoke. The door of the van shut out the face
of the still smiling doctor (bless the man! he was
perhaps really pleased to see me safely off), and
we jogged slowly on.</p>

<p>Our conveyance stopped in the goods station
yard. Three of the soldiers managed to hobble
along without help, but the fourth, the same young
fellow in the K.O.S.B. who had travelled in my
carriage from Cambrai, had to be carried on a
stretcher. I followed very slowly across the railway
tracks, and then along the platform to where
our train was waiting. Two first-class carriages
were reserved for us, one for the "Offizier" I heard
them say, and another for the men. The train was
full, and passengers at every window stretched out
their heads in curiosity, but none made any remark.
We did not stay many minutes in the station. As
the train moved off, Mr Poerringer was talking to
some of the station officials and did not look up.
He had not spoken to me since leaving the gates
of Marienberg, and perhaps had mistaken my state
of stupor for sulks.</p>

<p>It is not often that events in life will so be
shaped that the highest state of happiness can
be obtained merely from the fact of finding one's
self alone in a railway carriage. The absence of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_287" title="287"> </a>
a sentry made itself pleasingly felt. The sitting
on a soft cushion was a long-forgotten source of
contentment. In my selfish joy I nearly forgot
the friends I had left at the Festung.</p>

<p>On the left side of the line as you leave Würzburg,
the Fortress stands out on the hillside at
a distance of something over a mile as the crow
flies. The windows of my former quarters, where
we used to stand and watch the trains, could just
be recognised, and as I looked a white sheet
was waved up and down from the English room.
I answered back with my handkerchief, waving
it until the Festung Marienberg had passed out
of view.</p>

<p>The soldiers in the adjoining carriage, having
discovered that a communicating door between
our two carriages was open, came in to keep me
company. M&mdash;&mdash;, in the K.O.S.B.'s, remarked
that this was a pleasanter journey than the last
we had performed together. I asked him about
the other men who had been in our party, but
he had lost sight of them. M&mdash;&mdash; looked thin and
pale, and in far worse condition than when he left
Cambrai. He told me that he had been kindly
treated in hospital, but had been given very little
nourishing food. Another man who was wounded
in the spine and had been in another ward in the
same hospital, said the treatment was fair but food
short. All the other men complained of the want
<a class="pagenum" name="page_288" title="288"> </a>
of food. They said that the able-bodied prisoners
were most willing to work to escape the monotony
of prison life, but that they were given so little
food in the work camps that many of them were
unable to stand the long hours, and had to return
to hospital.</p>

<p>My recollection of this part of our journey is
most vague. I took a childish pleasure in recognising
the country through which we were passing,
and in comparing my feelings on the two journeys.
Near the first little country station after you leave
Würzburg there is a large nursery, and a large
notice put up by Herr Somebody with the words
"Baumschule." Farther on the train passes close
to a large quaintly roofed building bearing the
inscription "Jägerhaus." On the journey from
Cambrai I had noticed these things, and my
thought, anxious to get away from reality, had
speculated about the Jägerhaus and its past history,
and had wondered if the owners of the
Baumschule sold plants at a price cheaper than
obtained at home.</p>

<p>But now, during the first few hours of the
journey, my mind was incapable of taking in
impressions. We stopped at Aschaffenburg, probably
outside the station. I have no recollection.
We stopped many times in the afternoon, but we
took little or no interest. The men had a very
small piece of black bread each, and I gave them
<a class="pagenum" name="page_289" title="289"> </a>
my Leberwurst and the brown bread. Darkness
came down soon. We stopped at stations now
and again, and rejoiced each time the train
moved on.</p>

<p>Night had long fallen when we made our first
change. I do not remember the name of the
station, but the place appeared to be of considerable
size. We were helped out of the carriage
by Red Cross attendants, and saw no soldiers with
fixed bayonets. I was offered the choice of a
stretcher or a bath-chair, and chose the latter.
The night was dark and wet, the station badly
lit up.</p>

<p>We were taken along the platform and put into
the Red Cross dressing-station, which contained
a sofa, two arm-chairs, an operating-table which
looked as if it had never been used, and a glass
cupboard with medicine bottles, rolls of lint, &amp;c.
An oil-lamp hanging from the ceiling threw a
dim light.</p>

<p>After five minutes' wait an official looked in at
the door, and was about to pop out again, when
I asked a question: "Can we have something to
eat?" The official said "Wait," disappeared,
and promptly returned with three of his fellows.
They were surprised at hearing we had not dined
(it was, I think, now about 9 o'clock), and seemed
doubtful if anything could be done in the absence
of special orders. The situation was made easier
<a class="pagenum" name="page_290" title="290"> </a>
by my offering to pay. "Für alle?" they said.
"Yes, für alle."</p>

<p>I was wheeled off at once in the bath-chair still
farther along the platform to the station restaurant,
a small tidy room with half a dozen small
tables covered with clean white table-cloths. A
waiter came forward, helped me into a chair, and
presented the menu. I ordered a beefsteak, with
potatoes and peas. It was pleasant to sit down
to a clean white table-cloth, with a plate (instead
of the trough used in the Festung) and knives
and forks and spoons.</p>

<p>Presently the beefsteak arrived, beautifully
cooked and daintily served. I asked for some
beer, but this was "verboten." "Well, then,
bring me a tumbler and a corkscrew," said I,
withdrawing from my greatcoat pocket the bottle
of stout which Reddy had given me on my departure
from the Fortress.</p>

<p>The price of this excellent dinner was 1&nbsp;m.&nbsp;75,
including a cup of coffee. This was at a time
when Germany was reported in our papers to be
suffering from shortage of food supplies. The
menu offered a great variety of dishes, and the
only evidence of scarcity to be noticed was the
small-sized ration of bread with which I was
served.</p>

<p>After the coffee, and cigars! the Red Cross
official came in to say that it was time to take
<a class="pagenum" name="page_291" title="291"> </a>
places in the train. This time we had no longer
the luxury of a first-class carriage, but still there
was plenty of room, as we had a whole coach
consisting of four or five third-class compartments.
The men said they had been given a very good
dinner, for which no payment was demanded.</p>

<p>Just before the train started our party was
increased by the addition of a sentry. The men
had all settled down to sleep in the different compartments,
and the new arrival shared a carriage
with me.</p>

<p>He was of a very different type from the soldiers
who had guarded us on the other journey&mdash;a
young man, probably of good position, and certainly
of good education, very fat, unhealthily so,
quite bald, and wearing gold-rimmed spectacles;
he spoke with a North German accent, very difficult
for us to understand. He desired nothing
better than conversation, and told me all about his
own adventure with the army that marched on
Antwerp, where he had contracted typhoid fever
which had left him bald and short-sighted. He
was now condemned to transport work for the
duration of the war, and did not hesitate to say
to me that the prospect was distinctly disagreeable.
We both agreed that war was unpleasant
for every one concerned.</p>

<p>Our ultimate destination was Flushing, but my
friendly fellow-traveller only expected to go with us
<a class="pagenum" name="page_292" title="292"> </a>
as far as Osnabrück, at which town we could not
hope to arrive before midday of the day after
next. The train we were now in contained a
number of wounded Germans. They came along
the corridor during the night and made friends
with our party. Some of them could speak a
little English. Like all the other German soldiers
I have heard discussing the war, these men expressed
great reluctance to return to the front,
and were hopeful that the war would speedily be
terminated. This is probably the normal attitude
of every soldier on both sides.</p>

<p>The German soldier is oppressed by the unexpected
duration of the war. He is apparently
victorious on all fronts, and still the war drags on.
When he goes home on leave there is not much to
cheer him up. Every one seems to be in mourning,
and all his friends of military age are away. There
is one thing only that enables him to face the hardships
of war with unquestionable courage. From
childhood he has been taught that the highest
virtue in a man is loyalty to his Kaiser and the
Fatherland.</p>

<p>German patriotism finds its expressions in personal
loyalty to the Kaiser, and devotion to the
Fatherland which is almost fanatical. Some people
would say that conscription has played a large
part in the development of this national religion of
patriotism, but the history of the German people
<a class="pagenum" name="page_293" title="293"> </a>
can hardly be brought to support such a proposition.
Nor does the mere fact that patriotism
is taught in the schools provide a sufficient explanation.</p>

<p>The source of a flourishing, vigorous patriotism
may often be discovered from a study of economic
conditions. That patriotism is affected by economic
conditions must at once be admitted. In a
State, for example, where the majority of the population
are slaves, patriotism will be confined to the
slave-owners, who will fight vigorously to prevent
their slaves being captured by foreign slave-owners.
An agricultural country, where the majority of its
inhabitants are owners of the soil they till, affords
the most favourable environment for the growth of
patriotic sentiment. The Serbians are without
doubt the most patriotic people that history has
ever known, and Serbia is a country almost entirely
devoted to agriculture, where the great majority of
the inhabitants are owners of the soil, so that, in
the mouth of a Serbian peasant the words "my
country" refer to something more than an abstraction.</p>

<p>But German patriotism stands likewise on a
sound economic basis, for Germany possesses an
enormous agricultural population, the greater proportion
of whom are owners of the soil&mdash;the figures,
according to last available statistics, being 86 per
cent of the total population of the country. Starting
<a class="pagenum" name="page_294" title="294"> </a>
with these favourable conditions, the German
Government worked hard during peace-time to
strengthen by education and discipline the instinctive
patriotism of the citizens. Loyalty to
the Kaiser and Fatherland, respect for the army,
the duties of a citizen to the State, are lessons that
the German child is taught at school.</p>

<p>In addition to the economic and educational,
there is a third factor&mdash;and most essential of all&mdash;in
which Germany is by no means wanting. This
third factor is the influence of history and tradition.</p>

<p>"C'est la cendre des morts qui créa la patrie."</p>

<hr />

<p>A consideration of these three influences,
economic conditions, educational appeal to the
intellect, historical appeal to tradition, will help
us to understand the power of German patriotism.</p>

<p>In one of the thoughtful editorials to which
readers of the 'Irish Homestead' are accustomed,
I find condensed into a single phrase the idea
which I have been struggling to express. "Duty
to one's race," says "A.&nbsp;E.," "is not inevitable. It
is the result of education, of intellectual atmosphere,
or of the social order."</p>

<p>It is very necessary, but very difficult in war, to
keep in view the best side of the enemy's national
character. Now among the doctors, hospital attendants,
officers and men of the German army
<a class="pagenum" name="page_295" title="295"> </a>
with whom I came in contact during my stay in
Germany, I occasionally met with straight-dealing
and kindness. Three there are among them to
whom I would gladly give my hand. But though
in the main the Germans are a treacherous race,
coarse in pleasure, bestial in drunkenness, viciously
brutal in war; they are also brave, disciplined, and
patriotic. When the Fatherland is seen to be in
danger they will fight to the last loaf, to the last
cartridge, to the last man. There will be no sudden
collapse. There will be no surrender by attrition.
Ours is no easy road to victory.</p>

<p>The night was well on before our visitors retired
to their own compartment. The gold-spectacled,
bald-headed escort fell into a heavy sleep, uninterrupted
by the frequent stopping at cold, dark,
and lonely stations, where the train would sometimes
remain quiet and peaceful for perhaps a
quarter of an hour, but always started with a
sudden rattle and jerk just as I was thankfully
dozing off.</p>

<p>Of the following day I have little recollection.
Early in the morning we changed trains at a
small junction. It was bitterly cold, and the
platform, which was covered with snow, was
deserted. No stretchers or stretcher-bearers were
provided, and those of us who could not walk
were wheeled across the station in a truck by
two aged porters. Before starting afresh we had
<a class="pagenum" name="page_296" title="296"> </a>
a cup of hot coffee and a very small roll of bread
each.</p>

<p>The railway now ran through a hilly and thickly
wooded country, and our speed, which had never
been very rapid, was much reduced by long curved
gradients. Snow lay thick on the branches in the
dark spruce forests. Rosy-faced children, well
wrapped up, on their way to school, stopped on
the hard frozen road which ran beside the railway
line to watch the train go by and to wave their
hands and cheer. A pale wintry sun crept round
the horizon.</p>

<p>The railway carriage was almost as cold as the
corridor in the Festung Marienberg. Yesterday's
feeling of joy merely at the fact of being outside
the Fortress was now giving way to impatience at
the length of our journey and the slowness of the
train.</p>

<p>The picture changed in the afternoon. The train
was crossing the broad corn-lands of Westphalia,
which, as one huge field, stretch away to the
horizon. Here and there were patches of snow,
but no hedges, walls, or fence of any kind, and
scarcely a tree, can be seen to break the monotony
of the landscape. The farmhouses, few and far
apart, present a lonely and desolate appearance.</p>

<p>Yet another month and the newly-sown grain
would be sprouting, and six months would see
the rich harvest, and perhaps the end of bread
<a class="pagenum" name="page_297" title="297"> </a>
tickets in Berlin, for Westphalia is the granary
of the German Empire.</p>

<p>Shortly after dark we again had to change
trains. The platform was crowded with soldiers
and civilians. The snow had given way to a
drizzling rain, and as our train was not yet in,
we sat waiting on high-backed wooden seats, surrounded
by a curious and not too well-mannered
crowd. I remember one ugly old man with a
pointed grey beard, who shook his fist at us and
was full of hate, until the loud voice of a N.C.O.
ordered him to move on. The moment the order
rang out the crowd lost interest in our presence,
and the irascible old man was one of the quickest
to move.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to hear that another night
was not to be spent in the train, as the effects of
cold and the fatigues of the journey were beginning
to tell on the weaker members of the party.
However, we still had three hours to travel before
reaching the place where we were to stay the
night, and where, the escort said, rooms in a
hotel were awaiting us.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock before we reached our
destination. I am not sure of the place, but think
it was Cassel. The station was a large one, and
lit up with powerful electric lights. Our train
carried a big load of civilian passengers, chiefly
women, a great number of whom&mdash;in fact, nearly
<a class="pagenum" name="page_298" title="298"> </a>
all&mdash;wore deep mourning. We had to wait till
the platform was clear before the stretcher-bearers
came to carry us off.</p>

<p>I do not like being carried on a stretcher without
straps. That evening at Cassel we had the best
kind of stretcher, with a pillow and blankets which
were tucked in all round; and then with a big
strap across the chest and another about the
ankles, one felt quite secure.</p>

<p>We were first taken to the buffet, which is at
the far end of the station from our arrival platform.
On reaching the buffet we were unstrapped,
so we could sit up and take a cup of
warm milk, which was served out by uniformed
women attendants. We remained in the buffet
about half an hour. My stretcher was close beside
a table at which four big bony women dressed
in black were drinking hot coffee. A typically German
notice printed in large characters hung in a
conspicuous position on the wall:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="verse">Speak German! Do not use enemy language!</div>

      <div class="verse">Auf ein Rechtherzigesfrohesbaldigeswiedersehen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_299" title="299"> </a>
We had not seen any official frightfulness for a
long time. Some person in authority now came
in to the restaurant and lost his temper&mdash;not
with us, but with the fact of our being in the
restaurant. There was no one in charge of our
party, so the cursing fell upon the restaurant in
general; and shortly after the irate person had
departed we were carried away by stretcher-bearers
to the waiting-room, which was a few
yards farther down the platform.</p>

<p>Here we had to spend the rest of the night,
and nothing was said about the hotel and comfortable
beds for which our escort in the train
had led us to hope. The waiting-room was furnished
in a style common to most big Continental
stations. The arm-chairs, upholstered in dark-green
plush, were ugly and uncomfortable. The
two sofas were designed to repel the weariest of
travellers. Although large and lofty, the room
was efficiently heated by four large radiators,
and four enormous crystal candelabra hung in
the centre.</p>

<p>At the far end of the room, which was in semi-darkness,
as only one of the candelabra had been
turned on, a lady in mourning was sitting alone
at a small round marble-topped table. When the
stretcher-bearers had gone, the lady spoke to us
in perfect English. "Are you the poor soldiers
who are going back to England?" she said. "How
<a class="pagenum" name="page_300" title="300"> </a>
glad you must be! I read about the exchange of
prisoners in the paper." This lady was of German
birth, and had lived most of her life in Australia.
She said the nations of Europe had gone mad,
and that "this exchange of prisoners was the
first sign of sanity that she had seen since leaving
Australia." She asked if we had had any dinner,
and said it was too late now to get anything to
eat, but that if we rang the waiter would serve
hot coffee.</p>

<p>In answer to the bell the waiter came at once,
and I asked him if we could have some beer. He
seemed to hesitate a minute until I produced a
20-mark note. The beer was brought in tumblers
of frosted glass about a foot high. It was the
best Pilsener. Britain can brew nothing to touch
it. There was nothing in the waiting-room just then
really altogether German except the beer (and the
ugly, uncomfortable chairs). There was very little
German about the waiter, who while waiting for
our glasses to be emptied, entered into fluent
conversation with one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>And the astonishing subject of his conversation
was league football. The wounded soldiers, who
were inclined to be sleepy when the Australian
lady was bewailing the European situation, were
now thoroughly enjoying themselves. The waiter
told us that he had toured the North of England
with a German football team during the winter
<a class="pagenum" name="page_301" title="301"> </a>
of 1912-13; he knew all the professional clubs,
and was personally acquainted with many of the
favourite players in the north country.</p>

<p>One of the wounded men&mdash;Private Henry, Lancs.
Fusiliers, who was an expert follower of league
football&mdash;started a friendly but determined argument
with Fritz (as they called the waiter) as to
the merits of the different teams.</p>

<p>Fritz was a real football enthusiast. "I shall
never play again," he said; "I am to be called
up in a few weeks, and even if I get through I
can never play in England again."</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Fritz!" I said; "you have got the
best beer in all the world, and as we are not likely
ever again to get a chance of drinking it, you had
better bring in another round."</p>

<p>Some of the Red Cross attendants who were on
duty in the station that night, young fellows of
fifteen or sixteen, paid us a visit but did not stay
long; they could not join in our conversation, and
they refused my offer of beer with a regretful
"verboten."</p>

<p>A soldier friend of Fritz's came in to see us.
He had been slightly wounded in Russia some
six weeks ago, and was now on his way to the
Western Front, much depressed.</p>

<p>Fritz promised to bring in coffee and rolls at
six o'clock (our train was to leave at seven). Two
of the soldiers slept on the floor, and two dozed in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_302" title="302"> </a>
the arm-chairs. Even the fatigue of the journey
and the soporific influence of beer did not suffice
to induce sleep on the sofa.</p>

<p>Our escort of the previous day joined us at the
train next morning. Only a single third-class
carriage was provided for this part of our journey,
and as it was a very narrow one we were all most
uncomfortable. We would reach Osnabrück at
11&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span>, and there, we were told, "the exchange
would take place." I speculated wildly as to
what form or ceremony would be followed. The
local morning paper threw some light on the
subject with a statement "that the wounded English
officers and men about to be exchanged were
to be assembled at Osnabrück from all parts of
Germany previous to being sent over the frontier."</p>

<p>The train seemed to go slower than ever. We
came to a part of the line which had been flooded,
and a squad of men were repairing the track and
rebuilding a bridge. The men were of military
age, and our escort said they were Russian
prisoners. I noticed in many places along the
line that a lot of rough ground had been broken
up and brought into cultivation.</p>

<p>Now this work requires able-bodied, healthy
young labourers, especially when trees have to be
felled and roots removed, and there is no doubt
that the prisoners of war are being used for this
purpose. Indeed, most of the agricultural work
<a class="pagenum" name="page_303" title="303"> </a>
is carried on by prisoners, so that the full strength
of Germany's enormous agrarian population is
released for the fighting line.</p>

<p>We had to change trains once more (the seventh
or eighth change since Würzburg). Our escort,
who like ourselves was impatient at the continued
delay, expostulated with the station-master, who
explained that we had followed a circuitous route
in order to leave the main lines free for the passage
of troop trains. Large bodies of troops were at
that time being shifted from East to West or from
West to East.</p>

<p>The day dragged on, eleven o'clock passed, the
hour we were due to arrive at our destination, and
still the train monotonously bumped along the
single track of the badly-laid country railroad.
Our third-class carriage was very cramped and
uncomfortable. Such carriages are really not
"third-class" according to English notions. But
we did not worry about mere physical discomfort.
I do not know what my wounded comrades had
in their minds. They hardly spoke. But the expression
in the face of each man had been changing
from the moment they had left the hospital hut
<i>Baracken</i> at Würzburg.</p>

<p>In my own mind a change had also been working
since leaving the Festung Marienberg, with its
omnipresent sentries, noisy barrack-rooms, and
insolent, ill-mannered commander.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_304" title="304"> </a>
Now that I was no longer treated like a dangerous
criminal, I began to think and act in a more rational
way. But the change was very slow. For long
after I had reached my own home I retained a
silent and suspicious manner, which was surprising
perhaps to those of my friends who did not know
the full story of the Festung Marienberg. I have
drawn no exaggerated picture of that prison. I am
afraid there are places even worse than Würzburg,
although in other prisoner camps, such as Crefeld,
Neu Brandenburg, Stralsund, the conditions are
very different, and from trustworthy accounts I
believe that at Stralsund in particular the officers
could not wish for better treatment. They are
allowed to play cricket, football, tennis, &amp;c., whenever
they wish. They can even visit the town
under escort, and have a three-hole golf-course,
which one of my friends there tells me is "bogey
nine." I am thankful that, owing, I believe, to
the action of the American Embassy in Berlin, the
four British prisoners whom I left behind at Würzburg
have been sent to another Fortress in Bavaria,
where they are allowed a considerable amount of
liberty, and where life is much more endurable than
it was at the Festung Marienberg.</p>

<p>On arrival at Osnabrück at 1.30&nbsp;<span class="small">P.M.</span> on Saturday
the 14th February, my experience as a prisoner of
war in Germany came to an end. From that day
to the crossing of the Dutch frontier on the night of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_305" title="305"> </a>
Monday 16th, I was treated with all possible kindness,
and every material comfort that could be
wished for was offered or provided. I was no
longer treated as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Two private motor-cars were waiting at the
station to take us to the hospital. Three of our
party went off in the first car, and I with the
remaining soldier was lifted into the other, and
carefully covered up with warm rugs by the officer
who had come to meet the train. Both cars were
driven off to the hospital, where my companions
were to be lodged. The sun was shining frostily
as we drove through the bright clean town, which
is more Dutch than German in appearance.</p>

<p>The car stopped in a narrow street opposite a
verandah, with a flight of steps leading up from the
pavement. On this terrace or verandah stood an
old man, short, and heavy about the stomach,
dressed in black old-fashioned clothes. He approached
me with a bow, washing his hands
with invisible soap, "Goot Morgen, sir," "Goot
Morgen,"&mdash;more washing&mdash;"Is there anything I
can do for you? You ask me. Komm this way,
please." He crossed a large entrance-hall. The
floor was tiled and slippery, so that I could scarcely
walk on it. Sofas were set all round and down the
centre, and one or two wounded German soldiers
sat reading. They paid very little attention to our
arrival. I was shown into an enormously big hall
<a class="pagenum" name="page_306" title="306"> </a>
containing about 200 beds. This (from the stage
at the far end) had doubtless been a music
hall.</p>

<p>The room, which was lofty, but not well lit up,
except at the stage end, where there was but a
single large window, had been freshly painted
white. The beds were ranged all round, and a
double row down the centre.</p>

<p>Everything in the room was new. Beds, sheets,
blankets, none had ever been used before. By each
bedside was a small iron table, and behind each bed
hung the patient's hospital outfit, the ugly striped
pyjamas and red felt slippers. Everything new
and spotless.</p>

<p>The bald, gold-spectacled escort carried in my
luggage, and bade me an almost affectionate farewell.
I was becoming quite inured to surprises of
this kind.</p>

<p>In spite of a notice on the wall which said that
lying down on the beds in the day-time is strictly
forbidden, I lay down on the bed nearest the door
and tried to forget my excitement in sleep, but
before very long I was aroused by voices from the
other side of the screen at the door, and R.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;R.
walked round in his kilt, looking just the same as
when I had last seen him at Joigny la Chaussée.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to see you," he said; "we
heard you were killed, and then we heard you were
in England."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_307" title="307"> </a>
"How have you got into this party?" I replied;
"there is nothing much wrong with you."</p>

<p>Four other British officers followed in behind R.D.
I had expected to see a far more crippled band.
Major D&mdash;&mdash; was the worst of the four. One arm
was badly paralysed. He spoke with difficulty, a
bullet having grazed his windpipe leaving a nasty
scar, and he had one or two other bullet wounds in
the leg.</p>

<p>M&mdash;&mdash; and W&mdash;&mdash; were very lame; each had a
broken leg, badly set and short. Captain M&mdash;&mdash;
had nothing wrong with his arms or legs, but a
shrapnel bullet had hit him in the face, gone down
through the roof of his mouth, and stuck somewhere
in his neck, which was bandaged up.</p>

<p>The worst case of all was H&mdash;&mdash;, who presently
came in, supported and half carried by two orderlies.
No man in this war has had a nearer shave than
H&mdash;&mdash;. He was shot through the base of the neck,
and the bullet chipped the spine, causing partial
paralysis on one side and complete paralysis on the
other. I think it was his cheery spirit and sense of
humour that helped to keep him alive.</p>

<p>All of us had long stories to tell. W&mdash;&mdash; had
the most to say, having been shut up for three
months with some Russian officers who knew
neither French nor English. The remainder of
the party all came from Crefeld, which is not many
hours by train from Osnabrück.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_308" title="308"> </a>
For some reason the new arrivals were not
allowed to have a bath. We were told that anything
we fancied either to eat or drink could be
ordered for dinner, but that if we did not wish
to pay for our food, the ordinary hospital fare
would be at our disposal free of charge. We
ordered, and were served, a first-rate dinner.</p>

<p>During the afternoon a party of French officers
walked into the ward. One of them was rather
lame, but the others seemed in very good health.
Surprise at the meeting was mutual. They spoke
but little English. When we said that we were
the prisoners about to be exchanged, these poor
fellows had just for a moment a gleam of hope that
they also by some mistake were to come with us.
We had been together only a few minutes when
a soldier came in and took them away. In the
short time I had, however, found out that these
French officers had no complaint to make of the
treatment they had received, and they informed
me that a special difference was made in their
favour as compared with the British.</p>

<p>Soon after a most excellent dinner, we were glad
to turn in. German beds are made in some strange
manner. The bedclothes are not tucked in at all,
but are folded across the bed in a puzzling sort of
way. However, the bed was extremely comfortable,
and I slept soundly, the first time since
leaving Cambrai.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_309" title="309"> </a>
The next day, Sunday 15th, was a very long
one. We were not allowed to leave the ward,
which, on account of its huge size, the lack of
windows, and the uniform whiteness, was a most
depressing place. In the afternoon some kind of
religious service took place in the adjoining ward&mdash;at
least we heard singing of hymns to the
accompaniment of a powerful organ&mdash;and the
proceedings, whatever they were, terminated with
"Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles."</p>

<p>The event of the evening was the announcement
that next morning we were to appear before a
Medical Board, and immediately after would leave
for Holland. This piece of information was received
with calm. For my part I still had some
of the old reluctance to believe in good news, and
Major D&mdash;&mdash; spoke the thought of all when he
said, "We are not yet out of the wood." H&mdash;&mdash;,
the most crippled of the party, was the only
optimist.</p>

<p>Next morning, shortly after ten o'clock, I was
crossing the outer hall&mdash;that is to say, I was
creeping round by the wall, not daring to venture
across the well-polished floor&mdash;when the Board
emerged from a doorway behind me. They stood
and watched me make a laborious circuit back to
our room.</p>

<p>We stood to attention, those of us who were
able to stand, while the seven or eight German
<a class="pagenum" name="page_310" title="310"> </a>
officers filed into the room and took their seats
at the table which runs across the whole breadth
of the ward, opposite the entrance door. These
were men of high rank, and all of a large size
except one stout, short fellow, who acted as interpreter.
Our names were called, and the examination
proceeded in order of seniority. There
was no hesitation about any one until Captain
M&mdash;&mdash; was called. His case was the subject of
a certain amount of guttural discussion. R.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;R.
was the last and longest to be examined, and his
fate hung in the balance. The Board seemed to
be of opinion that he was not to be exchanged.</p>

<p>The discussion lasted but a few minutes, during
which R.&nbsp;D. stood pale and with anxious eyes.
They again began to question him. "How many
years' service did you say?" "Three." "Can
you drill troops?" "Very little." "Are you
qualified to teach musketry?" "No."</p>

<p>Again the withered hand was examined to see if
any sign of life could be found in the blue twisted
fingers.</p>

<p>I think the casting vote in R.&nbsp;D.'s favour was
given by the senior doctor, the only one of
the party who was in mufti, and one of the
few really human beings I have met while in
Germany.</p>

<p>Before going out the senior officer present (a
General) made us a speech in German, which was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_311" title="311"> </a>
translated to us by the interpreter somewhat as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is all right! You have all passed, and it
only remains for you each to come and sign the
necessary papers in the doctor's room. The
General wishes to know if you have any complaint
to make about your treatment, and if there is
anything you are not satisfied about the way you
have been treated while in Germany you must tell
us about it. We wish you to make now any complaints.
We want you to be satisfied. You must
go back to England contented." "We want you
to go back to England contented." He repeated
these words several times, walking up and down
the room as he spoke, looking round with a quick
glance at our faces, while the Board in the background
nodded approval.</p>

<p>There were no complaints. I thought in silence
of my journey from Cambrai to Würzburg, and of
the Rittmeister at the Festung Marienberg.</p>

<p>Here was the explanation of the sudden change
which began the day of departure from the Festung,
the explanation of the first-class carriage at
Würzburg station, the indifferent attitude of the
crowd on our journey, the good-fellowship of sentries,
the free and friendly intercourse with wounded
German soldiers, the attention and luxuries provided
at Osnabrück. "They" wanted us to go
back to England contented.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_312" title="312"> </a>
After the Board had gone the interpreter came
back again to make sure&mdash;"Please, gentlemen,
mention anything. You are all satisfied. Is good,
that is gut," and out he went at last rubbing his
hands.</p>

<p>"They" had evidently given orders that the
about-to-be-exchanged prisoners were to be treated
with kindness, just as "They" on a former occasion
had given orders that British wounded
prisoners, officers and men, were to be treated
with a special insolence and brutality.</p>

<p>This affectation of kindness now at the very last
moment, the hypocritical pretence, was more repellent
than even the insolence of the Rittmeister
Niebuhr.</p>

<p>There was, however, one member of the Board
whose kindness was really genuine. This was the
senior doctor in civilian clothes.</p>

<p>When I went along to the room where the papers
had to be signed, he made me sit in his arm-chair
and examined my head. I cannot explain the
difference between his manner and that of the
others. Kindness, in the others so evidently sham,
official, and by order, with him was second nature.</p>

<p>"You will get well, quite well in time," he said,
"but it will be very long."</p>

<p>"Let me take your arm, you must not fall on
the slippery floor. You might hurt yourself badly
and not be able to leave us to-night."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_313" title="313"> </a>
Even if I had not understood the German words,
there was no misunderstanding the sympathy in
the tone of his voice.</p>

<p>The word of deliverance came that evening while
we were at dinner. We were told that two motor-cars
and an ambulance waited at the door, and
in a very few minutes we started off for the station.
As the night was dark and wet, there was some
delay before the cars could find the platform our
train was due to start from. We drove into the
station by a goods entrance, and the cars halted
quite near the train. In addition to ourselves, a
large party of wounded soldiers, about 120 of them,
were bound for the frontier.</p>

<p>As I made my way slowly along the platform I
saw several of these poor fellows standing about on
crutches, one or two of whom I had met before
at Cambrai. They were very cheery, and it was
cheering to see them and hear the familiar query,
"Are we downhearted?" with its answering roar
from the train-load of cripples. But the thin pale
faces and ragged clothes bore witness to the misery
from which they, the lucky ones, were now to be
released.</p>

<p>After waiting for nearly two hours, a German
officer of high rank came along to make a final
inspection. He asked us if we had any complaints
to make, and again repeated the hypocritical
phrase, "We want you to go back to England
<a class="pagenum" name="page_314" title="314"> </a>
contented." And at last the train moved off.
Osnabrück is only forty miles from the frontier.
The suspense and worry of the day had told on
all of us, and when the much-longed-for moment
arrived, and the train actually crossed the frontier,
we had all fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Würzburg and all that nightmare in German
hands were already slipping far away into the
past. The reaction found expression not in hilarious
excitement or placid contentment, but in an
exceeding weariness of mind and body. Quite
early in the morning the train stopped at a small
station well over the German frontier. Two ladies
came along the corridor with baskets full of cakes,
oranges, tobacco, and other gifts. "Oh, you poor
men," said a voice in English, "is there anything
we can do for you?" It was the first Englishwoman's
voice we had heard for a long time (it
did seem such a very long time since we left
Southampton Water).</p>

<p>The voice and the kind words acted as a stimulant,
almost as a shock. Although the incident
may seem to be a trivial one, it is stamped in
my memory, for it awoke the memory of all that
England is, of kind human sympathy, of those
qualities so little understood by Germans.</p>

<p>We reached Flushing about 11&nbsp;<span class="small">A.M.</span> The
British Consul and a number of very kind people
came to meet the train and escorted us to the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_315" title="315"> </a>
hotel which is just opposite the station. Owing
to a very bad headache I had to spend the day
in bed.</p>

<p>Those of our party who were able went for a
walk as free men in the streets of Flushing.
They saw the arrival of German prisoners from
England, and compared their well-fed appearance
in smart clean uniforms with the ragged miserable
state of the unfortunate British soldiers. About
seven o'clock we were allowed to go on board the
steamer. In the dining-room of the hotel I met
Major Chichester, who had arrived with all the
one-armed and one-legged men from Madame
Brunot's Hospital at Cambrai. Many stretcher
cases were carried down the gangway, some with
bandaged heads and smiling faces; but one or two
stretchers were completely covered over, and one
dared not think of the burden they carried. Yet
others there were who, going back to England,
would never see England again. "Are we downhearted?"&mdash;the
cry was raised at intervals, and
from every quarter of the ship came the answer
in a convincing chorus.</p>

<p>During the long and very rough sea passage
my mind was taken up with the misery of the sea,
which in a bad sailor is able to dominate all else.
However, the discomforts of the sea journey
only intensified the relief of landing on English
soil at last.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_316" title="316"> </a>
It was about 8&nbsp;<span class="small">P.M.</span> before the hospital train was
ready to start for Charing Cross. At the end of
the saloon in which we were travelling a large
gramophone was playing a lively and rather catching
air. I asked an orderly the name of the tune,
and he, looking at me with an air of suspicion and
hesitation, not knowing the tune was unfamiliar to
us, replied at last, "It's a long long way to
Tipperary."</p>

<p>Indeed the way had seemed long.</p>
